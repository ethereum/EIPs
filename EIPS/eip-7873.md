## Abstract

EVM Object Format (EOF) removes the possibility to create contracts using creation transactions (with an empty `to` field), `CREATE` or `CREATE2` instructions. We introduce a new instruction: `TXCREATE`, as well as a new transaction type (`InitcodeTransaction`), to provide a way to create contracts using EOF containers in transaction data.

## Motivation

This EIP uses terminology from the [EIP-3540](./eip-3540.md) which introduces the EOF format.

Creation transaction and creation instructions `CREATE` and `CREATE2` are means provided by legacy EVM to deploy new code, but per requirement of removing code observability, they are not allowed to deploy EOF code. To allow Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to deploy EOF contrats, there must be a way to create EOF contracts using bytecode delivered in transaction data.

Additionally, the new instruction and transaction type introduced in this EIP enable contracts to create other contracts using initcode from the transaction data, which in legacy EVM is achieved via a combination of `CREATE` or `CREATE2` and loading the initcode from calldata. 

This mechanism complements `EOFCREATE` and `RETURNCONTRACT` instructions from [EIP-7620](./eip-7620.md), and thus all use cases of contract creation that are available in legacy EVM are enabled for EOF.

## Specification

### Transaction Types

Introduce new transaction `InitcodeTransaction` (type `INITCODE_TX_TYPE`) which extends [EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md) (type 2) transaction by adding a new field `initcodes: List[ByteList[MAX_INITCODE_SIZE], MAX_INITCODE_COUNT]`.

The `initcodes` can only be accessed via the `TXCREATE` instruction (see below), therefore `InitcodeTransactions` are intended to be sent to contracts including `TXCREATE` in their execution.

We introduce a standardized Creator Contract, which eliminates the need to have create transactions with empty `to`. See [Creator Contract](#creator-contract) for details.

#### Gas schedule

`initcodes` items data costs the same as calldata: transaction gas of an `InitcodeTransaction` is extended to include tokens in `initcodes` alongside tokens in `calldata`. Using the conventions from [EIP-7623](./eip-7623.md), the transaction gas is calculated as:

```python
STANDARD_TOKEN_COST = 4
TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN = 10

tokens_in_calldata = zero_bytes_in_calldata + nonzero_bytes_in_calldata * 4
tokens_in_initcodes = zero_bytes_in_initcodes + nonzero_bytes_in_initcodes * 4
tx.gasUsed = (
    21000
    +
    max(
        STANDARD_TOKEN_COST * (tokens_in_calldata + tokens_in_initcodes)
        + execution_gas_used,
        TOTAL_COST_FLOOR_PER_TOKEN * (tokens_in_calldata + tokens_in_initcodes)
    )
)
```


#### Transaction validation

- `InitcodeTransaction` is invalid if there are zero entries in `initcodes`, or if there are more than `MAX_INITCODE_COUNT` entries.
- `InitcodeTransaction` is invalid if any entry in `initcodes` is zero length, or if any entry exceeds `MAX_INITCODE_SIZE`.
- `InitcodeTransaction` is invalid if the `to` is `nil`.

Under transaction validation rules `initcodes` are not validated for conforming to the EOF specification. They are only validated when accessed via `TXCREATE`. This avoids potential DoS attacks of the mempool. If during the execution of an `InitcodeTransaction` no `TXCREATE` instruction is called, such transaction is still valid.

Legacy creation transactions (any transactions with empty `to`) that start with the two bytes `EF00` will be invalid. They will not be parsed into EOF containers and they will not be executed as legacy bytecode.


#### RLP and signature

Given the definitions from [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) the `TransactionPayload` for an `InitcodeTransaction` is the RLP serialization of:

```
[chain_id, nonce, max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit, to, value, data, access_list, initcodes, y_parity, r, s]
```

`TransactionType` is `INITCODE_TX_TYPE` and the signature values `y_parity`, `r`, and `s` are calculated by constructing a secp256k1 signature over the following digest:

```
keccak256(INITCODE_TX_TYPE || rlp([chain_id, nonce, max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit, to, value, data, access_list, initcodes]))
```

The [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) `ReceiptPayload` for this transaction is `rlp([status, cumulative_transaction_gas_used, logs_bloom, logs])`.

### Execution Semantics
    
Introduce a new instruction on the same block number [EIP-3540](./eip-3540.md) is activated on: `TXCREATE` (`0xed`).
    
#### `TXCREATE`
    
- deduct `TX_CREATE_COST` gas
- halt with exceptional failure if the current frame is in `static-mode`.
- pop `tx_initcode_hash`, `value`, `salt`, `input_offset`, `input_size` from the operand stack
- peform (and charge for) memory expansion using `[input_offset, input_size]`
- load initcode EOF container from the transaction `initcodes` array which hashes to `tx_initcode_hash`
    - fails (returns 0 on the stack) if such initcode does not exist in the transaction, or if called from a transaction of `TransactionType` other than `INITCODE_TX_TYPE`
        - caller's nonce is not updated and gas for initcode execution is not consumed. Only `TXCREATE` constant gas was consumed
    - let `initcontainer` be that EOF container, and `initcontainer_size` its length in bytes
- check that current call depth is below `STACK_DEPTH_LIMIT` and that caller balance is enough to transfer `value`
    - in case of failure return 0 on the stack, caller's nonce is not updated and gas for initcode execution is not consumed. Only `TX_CREATE_COST` constant gas was consumed.
- **validate the initcode container and all its subcontainers recursively**
    - unlike in general validation, `initcontainer` is additionally required to have `data_size` declared in the header equal to actual `data_section` size.
    - validation includes checking that the `initcontainer` does not contain `RETURN` or `STOP`
- fails (returns 0 on the stack) if container was invalid
    - caller’s nonce is not updated and gas for initcode execution is not consumed. Only `TX_CREATE_COST` constant and [EIP-3860](./eip-3860.md) gas are consumed.
- caller's memory slice `[input_offset:input_size]` is used as calldata
- execute the container and deduct gas for execution. The 63/64th rule from [EIP-150](./eip-150.md) applies.
- increment `sender` account's nonce
- calculate `new_address` as `keccak256(0xff || sender || salt)[12:]`
- behavior on `accessed_addresses` and address collision is same as `CREATE2` (rules for `CREATE2` from [EIP-684](./eip-684.md) and [EIP-2929](./eip-2929.md) apply to `TXCREATE`)
- an unsuccessful execution of initcode results in pushing `0` onto the stack
    - can populate returndata if execution `REVERT`ed
    - `sender`'s nonce stays updated
- a successful execution ends with initcode executing `RETURNCONTRACT{deploy_container_index}(aux_data_offset, aux_data_size)` instruction (see [EIP-7620](./eip-7620.md)). After that:
    - load deploy EOF subcontainer at `deploy_container_index` in the container from which `RETURNCONTRACT` is executed
    - concatenate data section with `(aux_data_offset, aux_data_offset + aux_data_size)` memory segment and update data size in the header
    - if updated deploy container size exceeds `MAX_CODE_SIZE`, instruction exceptionally aborts
    - set `state[new_address].code` to the updated deploy container
    - push `new_address` onto the stack
- deduct `GAS_CODE_DEPOSIT * deployed_code_size` gas

Note that the implementations are expected to cache the result of container validation for the time of current transaction execution, and therefore the cost of each container's validation is sufficiently covered by `InitcodeTransaction` intrinsic cost (initcodes charge).

### Creator Contract

We introduce a standardised Creator Contract (i.e. written in EVM, but existing at a known address), which eliminates the need to have create transactions with empty `to`.

At the start of the block in which [EIP-3540](./eip-3540.md) activates, set the code of `CREATOR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to `CREATOR_CONTRACT_BYTECODE`. `CREATOR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is not treated like a precompile. `CREATOR_CONTRACT_BYTECODE` corresponds to the following source code compiled to EOF:

```solidity
{
    /// Takes [tx_initcode_hash][salt][init_data] as input,
    /// creates contract and returns the address or failure otherwise

    // init_data.length can be 0, but the first 2 words are mandatory
    let size := calldatasize()
    if lt(size, 64) { revert(0, 0) }

    let tx_initcode_hash := calldataload(0)
    let salt := calldataload(32)

    mstore8(0, 0xff)  // a magic value to ensure a specific preimage space
    calldatacopy(1, 0, size)  // copy tx_initcode_hash, salt and init_data to memory to hash
    let commitment_size := add(size, 1)
    let final_salt := keccak256(0, commitment_size)

    let init_data_size := sub(size, 64)
    calldatacopy(0, 64, init_data_size)

    let ret := txcreate(tx_initcode_hash, callvalue(), final_salt, 0, init_data_size)
    if iszero(ret) { revert(0, 0) }

    mstore(0, ret)
    return(0, 32)

    // Helper to compile this with existing Solidity (with --strict-assembly mode)
    function txcreate(a, b, c, d, e) -> f {
        f := verbatim_5i_1o(hex"ed", a, b, c, d, e)
    }
}
```

## Rationale

### `TXCREATE` failure modes
    
`TXCREATE` has two "light" failure modes in case the initcontainer is not present and in case the EOF validation is unsuccessful. An alternative design where both cases led to a "hard" failure (consuming the entire gas available) was considered. We decided to have the more granular and forgiving failure modes in order to align the gas costs incurred to the actual work the EVM performs.

### Creator Contract

EOF contract creation requires a predeployed Creator Contract to be introduced, because neither legacy contracts nor create transactions can deploy EOF code to bootstrap. The alternative approach was to continue using legacy creation mechanisms, by either still relying on fetching the *initcode* from memory and not satisfy the overarching requirement of code non-observability, or to abuse the legacy creation transactions mechanism.

Since previous discussions about `TXCREATE`, which led to its removal from EOF along with the Creator Contract, there is wider consensus to allow predeploy contracts be put into the state, for example as a means to reduce the number of supported precompiles. Meanwhile, opinions about the importance of supporting deployments to deterministic, counterfactual, cross-chain addresses have been voiced by the community, making the case for this proposal stronger.

This also makes [EIP-7698](./eip-7698.md) (EOF - Creation transaction) no longer an essential requirement for deploying EOF contracts onto the chain. The EIP could be removed from EOFv1 and withdrawn.

### New address hashing scheme

`TXCREATE` uses the scheme `new_address = keccak256(0xff || sender || salt)[12:]`, same as `EOFCREATE` instruction. The decision whether to include initcontainer hash into salt is left to the `TXCREATE` caller. See [EIP-7620](./eip-7620.md) for detailed rationale.

### EOF creation transactions vs deployment patterns

Relying on the EOF creation transactions as alternative solution makes it impossible for smart contract wallets to deploy arbitrary EOF contracts (only EOAs can). At the same time, it is a use case current legacy creation rules allow, thanks to `CREATE` and `CREATE2` instructions. A workaround where those arbitrary EOF contracts are first "uploaded" to a factory contract, and then deployed using an `EXTDELEGATECALL`-`EOFCREATE` sequence, is very expensive, as it requires the deployed contract to be put on-chain twice. Because of this, the approach proposed in this EIP is more compatible with the Account Abstraction (AA) roadmap, where smart contract wallets should have feature parity with EOAs.

On top of this, relying on nonce-based hashing scheme to obtain addresses of newly created contracts, like in the case of the EOF creation transactions, would prevent EOF contracts from being deployed counterfactually to deterministic, cross-chain addresses. Introduction of the `TXCREATE` instruction, combined with the proposed "toehold" Creator Contract predeployed to an agreed upon address, supports this out of the box. ERCs can be written to provide other toehold contracts with features not supported by this inital contract, such as salt-less deployment and hashing in the sender's address as part of the salt.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change poses no risk to backwards compatibility, as it is introduced at the same time EIP-3540 is. The new instruction are not introduced for legacy bytecode (code which is not EOF formatted), and the contract creation options do not change for legacy bytecode. The transactions of the new type are invalid until this change activates.
