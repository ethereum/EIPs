## Abstract

This EIP defines a signature scheme for native [Simple Serialize (SSZ)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ef434e87165e9a4c82a99f54ffd4974ae113f732/ssz/simple-serialize.md) encoded transactions.

## Motivation

[EIP-6404](./eip-6404.md) introduces SSZ transactions by converting from RLP transactions. Defining a signature scheme for native SSZ transactions further reduces required conversions and unlocks the forward compatibility benefits of SSZ [`StableContainer`](./eip-7495.md).

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Transaction signature scheme

Native SSZ transactions are based on the `TransactionPayload` and `Transaction` types defined in [EIP-6404](./eip-6404.md) and emit an [EIP-6466](./eip-6466.md) `Receipt`. To distinguish native SSZ transactions from those converted from RLP, native SSZ transactions do not set an RLP `TransactionType` in their `TransactionPayload`.

All native SSZ transactions follow an identical scheme based on [`hash_tree_root`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ef434e87165e9a4c82a99f54ffd4974ae113f732/ssz/simple-serialize.md#merkleization) to compute their signing hash (`sig_hash`) and unique identifier (`tx_hash`).

Additional information is mixed into `sig_hash` to uniquely identify the underlying specification and avoid hash collisions across different signature kinds. Vendor-defined networks MUST use a different `DomainType` for signing custom transaction types.

| Name | Value | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `DOMAIN_TX_SSZ` | `DomainType('0x00000080)` | [`DomainType`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ef434e87165e9a4c82a99f54ffd4974ae113f732/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#custom-types) for signing native SSZ transactions compatible with this EIP |

```python
class ExecutionSigningData(Container):
    object_root: Root
    domain_type: DomainType

def compute_ssz_sig_hash(payload: TransactionPayload) -> Hash32:
    return Hash32(ExecutionSigningData(
        object_root=payload.hash_tree_root(),
        domain=DOMAIN_TX_SSZ,
    ).hash_tree_root())

def compute_ssz_tx_hash(tx: Transaction) -> Hash32:
    assert tx.payload.type_ is None
    return Hash32(tx.hash_tree_root())
```

### JSON-RPC

Certain JSON-RPC endpoints such as `eth_getTransactionByHash` indicate the corresponding [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) envelope type prefix in a `type` field.

When representing native SSZ transactions on such endpoints, `SSZ_TX_TYPE` SHOULD be indicated as their `type`, as defined in [EIP-6404](./eip-6404.md#networking). Omitting the `type` is NOT RECOMMENDED as certain client applications could confuse the omission with untyped `LegacyTransaction`.

### `Transaction` profiles

New [EIP-7495](./eip-7495.md) `Profile` definitions are introduced to represent native SSZ transactions:

- `BasicTransaction` shares the functionality of [EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md#specification) fee market transactions
- `BlobTransaction` shares the functionality of [EIP-4844](./eip-4844.md#parameters) blob transactions

```python
class BasicTransactionPayload(Profile[TransactionPayload]):
    chain_id: ChainId
    nonce: uint64
    max_fees_per_gas: BasicFeesPerGas
    gas: uint64
    to: Optional[ExecutionAddress]
    value: uint256
    input_: ByteList[MAX_CALLDATA_SIZE]
    access_list: List[AccessTuple, MAX_ACCESS_LIST_SIZE]
    max_priority_fees_per_gas: BasicFeesPerGas

class BasicTransaction(Container):
    payload: BasicTransactionPayload
    signature: Secp256k1ExecutionSignature

class BlobTransactionPayload(Profile[TransactionPayload]):
    chain_id: ChainId
    nonce: uint64
    max_fees_per_gas: BlobFeesPerGas
    gas: uint64
    to: ExecutionAddress
    value: uint256
    input_: ByteList[MAX_CALLDATA_SIZE]
    access_list: List[AccessTuple, MAX_ACCESS_LIST_SIZE]
    max_priority_fees_per_gas: BlobFeesPerGas
    blob_versioned_hashes: List[VersionedHash, MAX_BLOB_COMMITMENTS_PER_BLOCK]

class BlobTransaction(Container):
    payload: BlobTransactionPayload
    signature: Secp256k1ExecutionSignature
```

The `identify_transaction_profile` helper from [EIP-6404](./eip-6404.md) is updated to support native SSZ transactions.

```python
def identify_transaction_profile(tx: Transaction) -> Type[Profile]:
    if tx.payload.type_ is None:
        if tx.payload.blob_versioned_hashes is not None:
            return BlobTransaction

        return BasicTransaction

    else:
        if tx.payload.type_ == BLOB_TX_TYPE:
            return RlpBlobTransaction

        if tx.payload.type_ == FEE_MARKET_TX_TYPE:
            return RlpFeeMarketTransaction

        if tx.payload.type_ == ACCESS_LIST_TX_TYPE:
            return RlpAccessListTransaction

        if tx.payload.type_ == LEGACY_TX_TYPE:
            return RlpLegacyTransaction

        raise Exception(f'Unsupported transaction: {tx}')
```

## Rationale

The SSZ signature scheme reduces hashing overhead and ensures that `tx_hash` commitments are available on-chain. It also provides a flexible basis for future transaction functionality.

## Backwards Compatibility

The new transaction signature scheme is solely used for SSZ transactions and is represented using a different [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) envelope type prefix as existing RLP transactions.

## Security Considerations

SSZ signatures MUST NOT collide with RLP transaction and message hashes.

As RLP messages are hashed using keccak256, and all SSZ objects are hashed using SHA256. These two hashing algorithms are both considered cryptographically secure and are based on fundamentally different approaches, minimizing the risk of hash collision between those two hashing algorithms.

Furthermore, RLP messages are hashed linearly across their serialization, while SSZ objects are hashed using a recursive Merkle tree. Having a different mechanism further reduce the risk of hash collisions.
