## Abstract

This Meta EIP documents the activation details, parameter changes, and specification references for the second Blob-Parameter-Only (BPO) network upgrade, **BPO2**. It provides a canonical reference of blob target, blob maximum limits, and associated configuration values, enabling transparent tracking of incremental data availability scaling following BPO1 under Ethereum’s Surge roadmap.

## Motivation

Following the publication of the Meta EIP documenting **[BPO1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8134)**, this EIP extends the registry approach to **BPO2**, preserving continuity and enabling historical accuracy of blob capacity increases.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174).

This section documents the Blob-Parameter-Only upgrade identified as **BPO2**.

The upgrade modifies blob-related protocol parameters as defined in [EIP-7892](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7892). No other protocol behavior is affected. All timestamps are expressed as Unix epoch seconds (UTC).

### BPO-2 Parameters

| Field                    | Value       |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| BPO Identifier           | BPO2        |
| Activation Time (UTC)    | 1767747671  |
| Blob Target              | 14          |
| Blob Max                 | 21          |
| Base Fee Update Fraction | 11,684,671  |

BPO2 represents the second incremental blob capacity increase following BPO1 and continues staged scaling toward higher data availability limits.

### Historical Context

For reference, prior blob schedules were established in earlier network upgrades and BPO1:

| Upgrade | Blob Target | Blob Max | Base Fee Update Fraction |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------------------------|
| **BPO1**   | 10 | 15 | 8,346,193 |
| **Prague** | 6  | 9  | 5,007,716 |
| **Cancun** | 3  | 6  | 3,338,477 |

BPO2 builds directly on the BPO1 parameter baseline.

### Data Source

The parameter values and activation times in this EIP are derived from eth client genesis configuration, including:

```json
"bpo2Time": 1767747671,
"blobSchedule": {
  "bpo2": {
    "target": 14,
    "max": 21,
    "baseFeeUpdateFraction": 11684671
  }
}
```

Client implementations may expose these values in different formats; this EIP reflects the canonical mainnet configuration values.

## Rationale

Documenting BPO2 improves transparency, discoverability, and coordination as Ethereum incrementally scales data availability. This reference enables ecosystem participants to reliably track parameter changes, compare historical behavior, and align tooling, research, and operational assumptions without relying on fragmented or informal sources.

## Backwards Compatibility
BPO2 changed only parameter values within the tested bounds.

## Security Considerations
BPO upgrades adjust blob throughput parameters and may impact network load characteristics. Careful monitoring, staged rollout, and ecosystem coordination are required to ensure stability.
