## Abstract

This EIP proposes to raise the maximum allowed size for contract code deployed on Ethereum from 24,576 bytes to 32,768 bytes.

## Motivation

The current 24KiB contract size limit can be restrictive for complex contracts and applications. Increasing the limit to 32KiB allows for more feature-rich contracts while maintaining reasonable constraints on block and state growth.

## Specification

1. Update the [EIP-170](./eip-170.md) contract code size limit of 24KiB (`0x6000` bytes) to 32KiB (`0x8000` bytes).
2. Update the [EIP-3860](./eip-3860.md) initcode size limit of 48KiB (`0xC000` bytes) to 64KiB (`0x10000` bytes).

## Rationale

- **Developer Flexibility:** Enables more complex contracts and features.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Existing contracts are unaffected.
- **Simplicity:** Only the size limit is changed, with no other protocol modifications.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change is not backwards compatible and must be activated via a network upgrade (hard fork). Contracts larger than 24KiB, up to 32KiB, will be deployable after activation.

## Security Considerations

A higher contract size limit may marginally increase the risk of denial-of-service attacks via large contracts, but the new limit remains conservative.
