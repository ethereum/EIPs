## Simple Summary

A permissionless factory for deploy of deterministic contracts addresses based on its bytecode. 

## Abstract

Some contracts are designed to be Singletons which have the same address no matter what chain they are, which means that should exist one instance for all, such as [EIP-1820] and [EIP-2429]. These contracts are usually deployed using a method known as [Nick]'s method, so anyone can deploy those contracts on any chain and they have a deterministic address.
This standard proposes the creation of a CREATE2 factory using this method, so other projects requiring this feature can use this factory in any chain with the same setup, even in development chains.    

## Motivation

Code reuse, using the factory becomes easier to deploy singletons.

## Specification

### [ERC2470] Singleton Factory

> This is an exact copy of the code of the [ERC2470 factory smart contract].

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.5.11;


/**
 * @author Ricardo Guilherme Schmidt (Status Research & Development GmbH)
 * @notice Singleton Factory (ERC-2470) deploys deterministic addresses based on it's initialization code.
 */
contract SingletonFactory {
    /**
     * @notice Deploys a deterministic address based on `_initCode`.
     * @param _initCode Initialization code.
     * @return Created contract address.
     */
    function deploy(bytes memory _initCode)
        public
        returns (address payable createdContract)
    {
        assembly {
            createdContract := create2(0, add(_initCode, 0x20), mload(_initCode), 0)
        }
    }
}
// IV is value needed to have a vanity address starting with '0x2470'.
// IV: 21279
```

### Deployment Transaction

Below is the raw transaction which MUST be used to deploy the smart contract on any chain.

```

```

The strings of `2470`'s at the end of the transaction are the `r` and `s` of the signature.
From this deterministic pattern (generated by a human), anyone can deduce that no one knows the private key for the deployment account.

### Deployment Method

This contract is going to be deployed using the keyless deployment method---also known as [Nick]'s method---which relies on a single-use address.
(See [Nick's article] for more details). This method works as follows:

1. Generate a transaction which deploys the contract from a new random account.
  - This transaction MUST NOT use [EIP155] in order to work on any chain.
  - This transaction MUST have a relatively high gas price to be deployed on any chain. In this case, it is going to be 100 Gwei.

2. Set the `v`, `r`, `s` of the transaction signature to the following values:

   ```
   v: 27,
   r: 0x2470000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002470'
   s: 0x2470000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002470'
   ```

   Those `r` and `s` values---made of starting and ending `2470`'s---are obviously a human determined value, instead of a real signature.

3. We recover the sender of this transaction, i.e., the single-use deployment account.

    > Thus we obtain an account that can broadcast that transaction, but we also have the warranty that nobody knows the private key of that account.

4. Send exactly 0.0247 ether to this single-use deployment account.

5. Broadcast the deployment transaction.

The resulting transaction hash is `0x3b537345267c692c34efa0b4e31d7ea7c59cf15d1fc0a357f90863f5dd974732`.

This operation can be done on any chain, guaranteeing that the contract address is always the same and nobody can use that address with a different contract.


### Single-use Factory Deployment Account

```
0x38caaE3E876adbB947C7319b971BABbd127B95ad
```

This account is generated by reverse engineering it from its signature for the transaction. 
This way no one knows the private key, but it is known that it is the valid signer of the deployment transaction.

> To deploy the registry, 0.08 ether MUST be sent to this account *first*.

### Factory Contract Address

```
0x247034FdD2F7C2Ca1EA5184025904d6D2265b084
```

The contract has the address above for every chain on which it is deployed.
### ABI for SingletonFactory:
```json
[
	{
		"constant": false,
		"inputs": [
			{
				"internalType": "bytes",
				"name": "_initCode",
				"type": "bytes"
			}
		],
		"name": "deploy",
		"outputs": [
			{
				"internalType": "address payable",
				"name": "createdContract",
				"type": "address"
			}
		],
		"payable": false,
		"stateMutability": "nonpayable",
		"type": "function"
	}
]
```

## Rationale

SingletonFactory does not allow sending value on create2, this was done to prevent different results on the created object.
SingletonFactory uses salt `0` to all deploys because each bytecode should contain only once instance (definition of Singleton).
