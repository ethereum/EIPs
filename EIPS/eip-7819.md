## Abstract

Introduce a new instruction that allows smart contracts to create (and update) delegation accounts that match [EIP-7702](./eip-7702.md)'s design. These accounts can be used similarly to [ERC-1167](./eip-1167.md) clones, with significant advantages.

## Motivation

Many on-chain applications involve creating multiple instances of the same code at different locations. These applications often rely on clones, or proxies, to reduce deployment costs.

Clones, such as the one described in ERC-1167 are minimal pieces of code that contain the target address directly in the code. That makes them extremely light but prevents any form of reconfiguration (upgradability).

Upgradeable proxies differ from clones in that they read the implementation's address from storage. This makes them more versatile but also more expensive to use.

In both cases delegating the received calls to an implementation using EVM code comes with some downsides:

- Calldata must be copied to memory before performing the delegate call
- If EOF is enabled, clones and proxy written in EOF do not support delegation to an implementation written in legacy EVM code, and are thus limited or possibly dangerous. This encourages the continued use of legacy EVM code.

EIP-7702 introduces a new type of object that has the expected behavior: delegation indicator. These objects are designed to be instantiated at the address of EOA's, but the same behavior could be re-used to implement clones at the protocol level. Using delegation indicators for this use-case provides upgradeability without the need for storage lookups if the contract calling the `SETDELEGATE` allows it. It also removes any issue related to code version incompatibilities.

### Account abstraction

Smart accounts, as in contracts that are "owned" by one or multiple keys and are intended to replace EOAs, are often deployed using clones or proxies that point to a singleton implementation. This forces a choice between having an upgradeable or a non-upgradeable design. Both designs come with downsides. Non-upgradeable design can leave you stranded with a buggy (or limited) account code. Upgradeable design comes with costs associated with fetching the implementation address.

The `SETDELEGATE` instruction would enable new factories to implement an upgradeable design without the added cost of the lookup. Factories could also deploy non-upgradeable variants, or even selectively disable the upgradeability of some accounts. Both the upgrade mechanism and the selective locking would be handled at the factory level, which removes the burden of implementing the upgrade logic into the account itself.

Additionally, using EIP-7702 delegations instead of clones/proxies moves the call redirection logic from the userspace to the protocol. This means fewer EVM operations, and thus a reduced gas consumption of every operation that calls these contracts. This includes the verification of signatures and the execution of user operations, but also transfers of assets that include a callback, such as [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) tokens.

### Scalability

Clones and proxy contracts are present in large numbers in the blockchain state. OpenZeppelin's [ERC-1967](./eip-1967.md) proxies are ~708 bytes. Using EIP-7702 delegations that are only 23 bytes would reduce blockchain state usage.

Additionally, clones and proxy contracts have to handle the redirection of the call in the userspace, which includes execution cost. Using EIP-7702 delegations, which would move the redirection to the protocol level, would reduce the gas cost of all operations that target. This means more gas / blockspace is available for the actual execution of the contracts.

## Specification

A new instruction (`SETDELEGATE`) is added at `0xf6`.

### Behavior

Executing this instruction does the following:

1. deduct `EMPTY_ACCOUNT_COST` gas
2. halt if the current frame is in `static-mode`
3. pop `salt`, `target` from the operand stack
4. calculate `location` as `keccak256(MAGIC ++ address ++ salt)[12:]`
5. add `location` to `accessed_addresses`, as defined in [EIP-2929](./eip-2929.md)
6. halt if the code at `location` is not empty and does not start with `0xEF0100` (no empty and not a delegation indicator)
7. add `EMPTY_ACCOUNT_COST - BASE_COST` gas to the global refund counter if `location` exists in the trie.
8. set the code of `location` to be `MAGIC ++ target`, matching the delegation process defined in EIP-7702.
    - Similarly to EIP-7702, if `target` is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` do not write the designation. Clear the code at `location` and reset the `location`'s code hash to the empty hash `0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470`.
9. push `location` onto the stack

The delegation indicator created at `location` behaves identically to those created by EIP-7702.

Note: The delegation is effective immediately upon the completion of the operation. Calls to the address as soon as the next operation will execute the newly delegated code.

The delegation indicators created by the `SETDELEGATE`Â opcode are the same objects as the one created using EIP-7702. Therefore, all the behavior specificities documented in EIP-7702 (`CODESIZE`, `CODECOPY`, targeting precompile, or chaining delegation indicator) also apply here. Any future EIP that modify the behavior of EIP-7702 delegation indicators should also apply to the delegation indicators created using `SETDELEGATE`.

### Parameters

There parameters are the same ones as used in EIP-7702.

| Constant                     | Value            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `MAGIC`                      | 0xef0100         |
| `EMPTY_ACCOUNT_COST`         | 25000            |
| `BASE_COST`                  | 12500            |

## Rationale

### Gas cost

The execution of the `SETDELEGATE` instruction involves fewer moving pieces than what EIP-7702 gas costs account for:

- there is no signature recovery
- there is no dedicated calldata that must be accounted for that is not already paid for at the transaction level
- there is no nonce update

Therefore, the cost of executing this instruction could be lower than EIP-7702. Numbers from EIP-7702 are reused for simplicity. They are lower than `CREATE` or `CREATE2` operations, making the use of this instruction competitive for the intended use-cases.

## Backwards Compatibility

TODO

## Security Considerations

### Delegator upgrades & deletion

Reusing EIP-7702 behavior, including clearing the code if the target is 0, results in the ability to upgrade or even "remove" the created designator. This process is controlled (and can be restricted) by the factory (the contract that calls `SETDELEGATE`). Some factories will add checks that prevent re-executing `SETDELEGATE` with a salt that was already used, making the create designator immutable. Others may allow access-restricted upgrades, but prevent deletion. In any case, guarantees about the lifecycle of the designator created using `SETDELEGATE` are provided by the contracts that call it and not by the protocol.

### Delegator chaining

As documented in EIP-7702, designator chains or loops are not resolved. This means that, unlike clones, chaining is an issue. This is however something developers are used to, as chaining proxy can result in strange behaviors, including infinite delegation loops.

Factories may want to protect against this risk by verifying that the `target` doesn't contain a designator. This can be achieved using a legacy contract helper that has access to `EXTCODEHASH`. It could also be done using other forms of introspection such as an `ACCOUNT_TYPE` instruction.

### Front running initialization

Unlike EIP-7702 signature, which can be included in any transaction, and can thus lead to initialization front-running if the implementation doesn't check the authenticity of the initialization parameters, `CREATE_DELEGATION` is executed by a smart contract that can execute the initialization logic atomically, just after the delegation is created. This process is well-known to developers that initialize clones and proxies just after creation.

### Multiple delegation changes within a single transaction.

If a contract performs multiple `SETDELEGATE` operations with the same salt but different targets within the same transaction, while doing calls corresponding address, this would have, in the same transaction without reverts, an address that has multiple different codes associated with it, two or more of which are executed. This include the delegation being removed/reset any number of time during the transaction.

This behavior, which is already mostly possible with more traditional upgradeable contracts.
