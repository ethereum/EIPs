# Precompile for Elliptic Curve Linear Combinations

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->


This EIP adds a precompile that allows whole classes of curves to be used.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

A precompile that takes a curve and computes a linear combination of curve points.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->



and compute the following


aka *linear combination*, *inner product*, *multi-multiplication* or even *multi-exponentiation*.

```
(Cx, Cy) := ecmul(m, α, β,  s0, Ax0, As0, s1, Ax1, As1, ...)
```

### Gas cost

```
BASE_GAS = ...
ADD_GAS  = ...
MUL_GAS  = ...
```


### Encoding of points


|--------|-----|
| `0x00` | Point at infinity |

Conversion from affine coordinates to compressed coordinates is trivial: `y' = 0x02 | (y & 0x01)`.

### Special cases







### Edge cases

* Non-prime moduli or too small modulus
* Field elements larger than modulus
* Invalid sign bytes
* x coordinate not on curve
* Returning the point at infinity
* (Please add if you spot more)

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

**Generic Field and Curve.** Many important optimizations are independent of the field and curve used. Some missed specific optimizations are:

* Reductions specific to the binary structure of the field prime.
* Precomputation of Montgomery factors.
* Precomputation of multiples of certain popular points like the generator.

The BN254 (aka alt_bn8) multiplication operation introduced by the [EIP-196][eip196] precompile only handles a single scalar multiplication. The missed performance is such that for two or more points it is cheaper to use EVM, as pratically demonstrated by [Weierstrudel][ws].

**Variable Time Math.** When called during a transaction, there is no assumption of privacy and no mittigations for side-channel attacks are necessary.

**Prime Fields.** This EIP is for fields of large characteristic. It does not cover Binary fields and other fields of non-prime characteristic.


TODO: Consider a double-word version. 512 bits would cover all known curves except E-521. In particular it will cover the NIST P-384 curve used by the Estonian e-Identity and the BLS12-381 curve used by [ZCash Sappling][sappling].

**Short Weierstrass Curves.** This EIP is for fields specified in short Weierstrass form. While any curve can be converted to short Weierstrass form through a [substitution of variables][cov], this misses out on the performance advantages of those specific forms.

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other EIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

There will be a reference implementation in Rust based on the existing libraries (in particular those by ZCash and The Matter Inc.).

The reference implementation will be production grade and compile to a native library with a C api and a webassembly version. Node developers are encouraged to use the reference implementation.

The webassembly version will specifically be suitable for use as a eWasm based precompile.
