## Abstract

Define the stages that Core EIPs go through in the process of planning network upgrades: `Proposed for Inclusion`, `Considered for Inclusion`, `Scheduled for Inclusion`, and `Included`.

## Motivation

When planning network upgrades, EIPs go through the `Considered for Inclusion` and `Included` stages. However, definitions for these terms are either outdated or non-existent. 

Additionally, there isn't a formalized way for the Ethereum community to signal which EIPs they'd like to see included in a network upgrade, or for implementation teams to keep track of these. 

This EIP proposes definitions for each of the following stages: `Proposed for Inclusion`, `Considered for Inclusion`, `Scheduled for Inclusion`, and `Included`. It also provides context and guidelines around when and how EIPs should be moved from one stage to the next. 

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Context: Upgrade Meta EIPs

When planning a network upgrade, anyone **MAY** draft an Upgrade Meta EIP to list EIPs in various stages of consideration. This Meta EIP **SHOULD** include three categories in its specification section: `Proposed for Inclusion`, `Considered for Inclusion` and `Scheduled for Inclusion`. Even if a category is empty, it **SHOULD** be included in the initial draft for clarity. 

When the Upgrade Meta EIP is moved to `Last Call`, the `Proposed for Inclusion` and `Considered for Inclusion` lists **SHOULD** be removed, leaving only `Scheduled for Inclusion`. 

Before the Upgrade Meta EIP is moved to `Final`, the `Scheduled for Inclusion` stage **MUST** be renamed to `Included` and contain only EIPs that were activated in the upgrade. 

### Proposed for Inclusion

To formally propose the inclusion of a Core EIP in a network upgrade, someone **MUST** open a pull request against the Upgrade Meta EIP to add the EIP in the `Proposed for Inclusion` section. Reasonable pull requests **SHOULD** be merged in a timely fashion by the Upgrade Meta EIP author.  

At this stage, implementation teams **SHOULD** review the EIP in the context of including it in the next upgrade. 

Note that EIPs must be `Proposed for Inclusion` for each network upgrade. In other words, proposals do not "carry over" to the next upgrade if an EIP is not included in the one it was first proposed for. 

### Considered for Inclusion 

Once client developers have reviewed an EIP which was `Proposed for Inclusion`, they **MAY** move it to the `Considered for Inclusion` stage. Once a decision is made by client teams to move an EIP to `Considered for Inclusion`, the Upgrade Meta EIP **SHOULD** be updated to reflect this.

`Considered for Inclusion` signals that client developers are generally positive towards the EIP, and that, assuming it meets all the requirements for mainnet deployment, it **MAY** be included in the network upgrade. This stage is similar to "concept ACK" in other open source projects, and is not sufficient to result in deployment to mainnet. An EIP **MAY** be removed from `Considered for Inclusion` if client teams are generally against including the EIP in the network upgrade. 

### Scheduled for Inclusion 

When client teams decide to work on an EIP as part of a network upgrade, the EIP **SHOULD** move to the `Scheduled for Inclusion` stage, and the Upgrade Meta EIP **SHOULD** be updated to reflect this. 

`Scheduled for Inclusion` signals that implementation and testing work are underway, and that, assuming no issues arise as part of this process, the EIP **SHOULD** be included in the network upgrade. An EIP **MAY** be removed from `Scheduled for Inclusion` if client teams are generally against including the EIP in the network upgrade. 

### Included

Once a network upgrade has been activated, all EIPs that were part of the upgrade **MUST** be moved to `Included` in the Upgrade Meta EIP, and the `Proposed for Inclusion`, `Considered for Inclusion` and `Scheduled for Inclusion` lists **MUST** be removed from the Meta EIP. 

`Included` signals that the EIPs have been activated as part of the network upgrade. 

## Rationale

Formalizing the `Proposed for Inclusion`, `Considered for Inclusion`, `Scheduled for Inclusion`, and `Included` stages provides better legibility to both Ethereum protocol maintainers and the community at large. 

The specification tries to minimize steps which **MUST** be followed to align with Ethereum's "rough consensus" governance model. 

Assuming it is adopted, the process outlined in this EIP should be used for at least one full network upgrade cycle before moving to `Last Call` and at least two full network upgrades cycles before moving to `Final`. This way, the EIP can be updated to reflect changes made to the process over time. 

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP does not directly change the Ethereum protocol. It extends and formalizes the current process of planning network upgrades. 

## Security Considerations

None.
