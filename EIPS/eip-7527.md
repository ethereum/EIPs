## Abstract

This proposal outlines a system that incorporates a Function Oracle capable of converting fungible tokens into a single non-fungible token each instance and then reverting the non-fungible token back to fungible tokens. The pre-configured Function Oracle comes equipped with its own Automated Market Maker (AMM), facilitating a clearing mechanism for voucher issuers.

## Motivation

The motivation behind a wrapping system with embedded Function Oracle AMM is to achieve decentralized credit endorsement and thus quantifiable decentralized credit assets with liquidity in nature. This creates an applicable infrastructure for credit creation, transmission, and oracle in payment, social, and financial context. Decentralized credit voucher can be implemented in the form of Non-fungible tokens, compatible with current Ethereum environment, which also expands its application scenarios. The concept of decentralized credit is highly integrated with dApps development. It aims to foster a more trustless environment.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Contract Interfaces: 

Three interfaces are included here: Agency, App, and Factory. 

Agency and App MAY be seperately implemented, but they SHALL be mutually bounded after initialization. Or, Agency and App MAY be both implemented in one single contract. 

Factory Interface is OPTIONAL, depending on whether the combination of Agency and App need to be deployed repeated. 

The Agancy MUST implement an Function as Oracle, which serves as AMM when token are wrapped or unwrapped. The App serves as a single entry point for all wrap and unwrap queries.

     * @param data The data to encode into the non-fungible token with identifier `tokenId`.
     */
    function burn(uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external;
 }

```

### Factory Interface 

If a factory is needed to deploy bounded App and Agency, the factory SHALL implement the following interface:

```

import {Asset} from "./IERC7527Agency.sol";
interface IERC7527Factory{
    /**
     * @dev Deploys a new agency and app clone and initializes both.
        * @param agencyImplementation The address of the agency implementation.
        * @param asset The parameter of asset of the agency.
        * @param immutableAgencyData The immutable data are stored in the code region of the created proxy contract of agencyImplementation.
        * @param agencyInitData If init data is not empty, calls proxy contract of agencyImplementation with this data.
        * @param appImplementation The address of the app implementation.
        * @param immutableAppData The immutable data are stored in the code region of the created proxy contract of appImplementation.
        * @param appInitData If init data is not empty, calls proxy contract of appImplementation with this data.
        * @return agencyInstance The address of the created proxy contract of agencyImplementation.
     */
    function deployWrap(
        address payable agencyImplementation,
        Asset calldata asset,
        bytes calldata immutableAgencyData,
        bytes calldata agencyInitData,
        address appImplementation,
        bytes calldata immutableAppData,
        bytes calldata appInitData 
    ) external returns(address);
}

```

## Rationale

### Mutual Bound

Implement contracts for `IERC7527App` and `IERC7527Agency` so that they are each other's only owner. The wrap process is to check the premium amount of the fungible token received and then mint non-fungible token in the App. Only the holder of the non-fungible token can unwrap it.

### Implementation Diversity : 

Users and customize function and fee percentage when implement the Agency and the App interfaces.

Different Agency implementations have distinct wrap, unwrap function logic, and different oracleFunction. Users can customize the currency, initial price, fee receiving address, fee rate, etc., to initialize the Agency proxy contract. 

Different App implementations cater to various use cases. They could be movie tickets, deposit receipts, bonds, stocks, and so on. Users can initialize the App proxy contract.

Factory is not required. Factory implementation is need-based. Users can deploy their own proxy contracts by selecting different Agency implementations and different App implementations through the Factory, combining them to create various products.


### Currency types and functions

Support ETH and [ERC-20](./eip-20.md).

### [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) - Required for ID

For each wrap process, a unique ID should be generated. This ID is essential for verification during the unwrap process. It also serves as the exclusive credential for the token. This mechanism ensures the security of assets within the Agency. While it's suggested, it's not mandatory to use the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) standard.

### Wrap and Mint

The strategy is set while implementing the Agency interface, which ensures it's not upgradable.

When executing the 'wrap' function, the predetermined strategy parameters are passed into the 'getWrapOracle' function to fetch the current price and fees. The respective premium is then transferred to the Agency instance and the fee receiving address. Subsequently, App tokens are minted to the user's address.

Need to check whether mint and wrap are mutually bounded and check uniqueness: Tokens transferred into the Agency cannot be moved, except through the unwrap process. The act of executing wrap is the sole trigger for the mint process. 

### Unwrap and Burn

"When executing the 'unwrap' function, predetermined strategy parameters are passed into the 'getUnwrapOracle' function to read the current price and fees. The corresponding premium is then transferred to the user's address and the fee receiving address, after which the App token is burned. The act of executing 'unwrap' is the sole trigger for the 'burn' process.

### Two interfaces use together

Two interfaces and be implemented together for safety, but they can be independently implemented before initialization for flexibiliy.

### Pricing

getWrapOracle and getUnwrapOracle are used to fetch the current price and fees. They implement on-chain price fetching through oracle functions. They not only support fetching the price and fees during the wrap and unwrap processes but also support other contracts calling them to obtain the price and fees, such as lending contracts.

Support Oracles based on on-chain and off-chain parameters. Suggest on-chain parameters only for consensus of on-chain reality.

## Security Considerations

### Fraud Prevention

Consider the following for the saftey of the contracts system:

* Check whether ERC7527Agency and ERC7527App are mutually bounded

* Check the function strategies

* Check whether the system can be subject to reentrancy attack

* Check whether all non-fungible tokens can be unwrapped with the premium calculated from Function Oracle AMM.
  
* Check whether no fungible tokens would be left in the contract account when all non-fungible Tokens are unwrapped.
