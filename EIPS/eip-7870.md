## Abstract

This proposal specifies hardware and bandwidth recommendations for full nodes and validators. Validators are split into attesters and proposers. The resource-intensive aspect of block proposal lies in creating the block and broadcasting the data required for attesters to validate it. We use the term "local block builder" to further emphasize this separation.

We note that you may be able to run a client with less than the recommended specifications, however benchmarks and decision-making will be made with respect to these recommendations.

## Motivation

Clear system specifications are crucial for:

- Ensuring meaningful benchmark comparisons across different implementations
- Enabling informed decision-making about protocol upgrades and their resource usage implications
- Providing clear guidance for node operators with respect to the future

Without a shared understanding of target hardware specifications:

- Benchmark results lose significance due to inconsistent testing environments
- Decision-making becomes challenging for implementation choices, as performance characteristics are heavily hardware-dependent
- Network participants lack clear guidance for hardware investments

## Specification

### Recommended hardware and bandwidth specifications

| Node type | Storage | RAM | CPU Cores | CPU Single Thread/Multithread rating | Download/Upload speed |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | --------| -------- |--------|
| Full node     | 4TB     | 32GB    | 4 cores/8 threads  | 1000 / 3000 | 50 Mbps / 15 Mbps |
| Attester      | 4TB     | 64GB    | 8 cores/16 threads | 3500 / 25000 | 50 Mbps / 25 Mbps |
| Local block builder | 4TB     | 64GB    | 8 cores/16 threads | 3500 / 25000 |  100 Mbps / 50 Mbps |

- The CPU rating is a measure of how powerful a particular CPU is for single and multithreaded respectively. All numbers referenced are normalized according to PassMark.

### Recommended Prebuilds (Attester and Local block builder)

#### Minisforum UM790 Pro

We recommend the Minisforum UM790 Pro with the following modifications:

- Minisforum UM790 Pro
- 8 cores
- 16 threads
- The barebones model will need to be updated to include 32GB RAM and 4TB storage
- CPU Rating
  - Single Thread: 3903
  - Multithread: 30367

#### ASUS NUC 14 Pro

- 16 cores (6 performance + 8 efficiency cores + 2 Low power efficiency cores)
- 22 threads
- CPU Rating
  - Single Thread: 3520
  - Multithread: 25158

### Recommended Prebuild (Full node)

#### Raspberry Pi 5

- 4 core
- 4 threads
- CPU Rating
  - Single thread: 1487
  - Multithred: 3428

## Rationale

### Storage

For storage, we recommend the following SSDs:

- Kingston KC3000
- Kingston Fury Renegade
- Samsung 990 Pro
- Seagate Firecuda 530
- Teamgroup MP44
- WD Black SN850X

In particular, we recommend purchasing NVMe M.2 instead of SATA as NVMe has higher throughput.

As of January 2025, the storage requirements for all node types are dominated by the need to store block history.
A 2TB disk can be used; however, this is not recommended due to the rate of history growth and the uncertainty as to when EIP-4444 will be completed.

### RAM

RAM/memory is dominated by state cache. As of January 2025, it is possible to run a full node with 16GB of RAM, however this has been known to not work with all combinations of EL and CL clients in the past.

On 32GB vs 64GB; 32GB works right now, however we recommend 64GB as [preliminary benchmarks](https://hackmd.io/@han/bench-hash-in-snark) have shown that zk-STARKS can consume a significant amount of memory and the difference in cost relative to the entire hardware setup for a validator is insignificant.

### Bandwidth

- Statista states that as of January 2024:
  - The global average download for broadband is 92 Mbps and the global average upload is 43 Mbps.
  - The global average download for mobile is 50 Mbps and 11 Mbps
- GSMA report showing the state of mobile internet connectivity in 2024 shows that:
  - The mobile upload speeds in Higher Income Countries (HIC) is about 18 Mbps
  - The global average mobile download is 48 Mbps.

Although most users will be using fixed broadband as opposed to mobile broadband. We include the mobile broadband figures as a way to approximate lower bounds.

#### Local block builders

For validators that want to build blocks locally, we recommend global bandwidth figures inline with the global average for fixed broadband: 100 Mbps download and 50 Mbps upload.

*If a block builder does not have the recommended bandwidth, we recommend that they build a block that is partially full and or one that includes less blobs.*

#### Attesters

For attesters, we recommend: 50 Mbps download and 25 Mbps upload.

The minimum value recorded to work as of January 2025 has been ~15 Mbps. This was recorded in simulations done by Eth panda ops where 40% of the network had Gigabit connections and the other 60% had 15 Mbps upload.

The minimum value could be lower than this and is highly dependent on your network topology.
For example, if you are connected to peers who have gigabit connections, but you yourself have subpar bandwidth, it may be sufficient for you to only send your data to the first peer and in the time it takes you to send data to your mesh, the first peer might have seeded the network.

The 25 Mbps was chosen as a buffer to account for these miscellaneous factors that are harder to predict.

#### Validators using mev-boost

The recommendation for validators using mev-boost is the same as the recommendations for attesters.

#### Full nodes

For full nodes, whom want to follow the tip of the chain, we recommend 50 Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload.

Full nodes currently participate in sampling, however since they are not latency sensitive like attesters and local block builders, we can lower their recommended upload bandwidth.

The recommended download speed is kept the same, so that they are able to follow the chain at the same speed as an attester.

Note: A full node will still be able to operate at significantly lower bandwidth, however depending on how low they may be at least a slot behind the chain.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is informational and requires no protocol changes. We recommend that future EIPs include an assessment of their impact on these hardware recommendations.
