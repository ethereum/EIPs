## Abstract

This EIP adds a flag to the block builder in order to allow them to include a client configured maximum amount of blobs. This is an execution layer only change.

## Motivation

Currently a builder will include all blobs in their local mempool, up to the maximum amount that the protocol requires. If a builder has low bandwidth, they may include too many blobs
and subsequently end up not being able to convince the network that the blobs are available.

## Specification

- Create a parameter in block builder's configuration called `USER_CONFIGURED_MAX_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK`
- Take the minimum out of the `MAX_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK` and the `USER_CONFIGURED_MAX_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK`
- If the minimum is zero, set the minimum to one.
- Use the minimum to decide how many blobs to include in the block

Note: By default `USER_CONFIGURED_MAX_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK` may be set to the maximum in the current fork.

## Rationale

By adding a flag for the local block builder, they are able to specify how many blobs they can include in a block.

## Backwards Compatibility
