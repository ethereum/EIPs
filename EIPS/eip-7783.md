This proposal describes the introduction in clients of a controlled gas target increase strategy to determine the gas limit of a specific block and set as default with conservative parameters, while keeping the possibility to change it in the future to a fixed value.

## **Abstract**

The EIP proposes the introduction of a new gas target management mechanism that automatically increases the block gas target over time. The incremental growth is controlled by a fixed rate, ensuring predictable network scaling while preventing sudden surges in block sizes. This strategy is meant to be used as a default setting, with the option to switch to a fixed gas target if needed (or different parameters).

## **Motivation**

### **Predictable Gas Target Growth**

- **Current Issue:**
  - The Ethereum network faces increasing demand, but changes to the gas target are often manually adjusted by miners or validators based on their preferences, which may cause unpredictable block sizes and network performance issues.

- **Need for Change:**
  - A systematic and predictable increase of the gas target will help scale the network while giving the ecosystem time to adjust to larger block sizes, without needing to rely on ad hoc decisions by network participants.

### **Gradual Increase with Deactivation Safeguard**

- **Controlled Growth:**
  - Instead of sudden or unpredictable changes, this EIP proposes incremental gas Target increases over a specified amount of time, ensuring a smooth transition to higher transaction throughput, while still keeping the governance of the gas Target in the hand of the community.
  
- **Automatic Deactivation:**
  - A safeguard deactivation block will halt the increase after some specified time, preventing the gas Target from growing indefinitely and allowing the community to reassess the network's needs.

## **Specification**

### **Incremental Gas Target Increase Strategy**

Add a new "Gas Target" selection strategy that takes in Block Number `N` and spits out the Gas Target `GT` for that block. The strategy is as follows:

 - The gas target `GT_t` at block `t` is calculated as:
```GT_t = min(GT_(t-1) + r, GT_cap)```
   Where:
    - `GT_(t-1)` is the gas target of the block `t-1`.
    - `r` is gas increase per block (for example 2.89).
    - `t` is the number of blocks since the implementation of the EIP.
    - `GT_cap` is the gas limit cap at which the function stops at.

If `GT_0` is set to 15 million gas, `r` to 3, and `t_last` to  5184000 (two years), the gas target will increase by 3 gas per block for two years, reaching 30 million gas at the end of a 2 years period (with `GT_cap` set to 30 millions).

### **Implementation**

- **Client Updates:**
  - Ethereum clients must implement the automatic gas target increase according to the specified rate and formula, with enforcement of the deactivation block. However, If the GasTarget has been locally set by the validator that will override the formula and take precedence.
  
- **Gas Target Management:**
  - Miners and validators are not required to adjust the gas target manually during this period, as the increase will be automated at the protocol level.

## **Rationale**

### **Predictable Growth**

- **Systematic Adjustment:**
  - The gradual increase avoids sudden surges in gas target that could destabilize the network. Instead, it provides a smooth transition, giving the ecosystem time to adapt to larger block sizes.

### **Controlled Target with Deactivation Block**

- **Automatic Safeguard:**
  - The inclusion of a deactivation block ensures that the gas target does not increase indefinitely, preventing potential negative impacts on network performance beyond the planned growth.


- **Community Consensus:**
  - The deactivation block serves only as a checkpoint for the community to evaluate the impact of the gas target increase, however, in the two-year period, the community can decide to halt the increase at any time and can also switch to a fixed gas target if needed.

## **Backwards Compatibility**

**No Hard Fork Required**

## **Security Considerations**


- The controlled gas target increase strategy is designed to prevent sudden changes that could lead to network instability or security vulnerabilities.
- The fact that validators can re-adjust the gas target in case of a DDOS attack or other issues, makes the network more secure than to just increase the gas target manually in a cliff-like manner.
