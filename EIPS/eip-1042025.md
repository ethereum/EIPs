## Abstract

This EIP introduces a structured checklist of questions for a common cover sheet to streamline topic evaluation for the All-Core-Devs call. By categorizing discussion points into focused areas, EIP-1042025 aims to enhance clarity and prioritize actionable insights. The checklist ensures proposals are rigorously vetted while aligning with Ethereum’s technical, economic, and governance considerations. This process aims to surface critical questions early in the discussion cycle.

## Motivation

The All-Core-Devs calls often grapples with intricate, overlapping topics that benefit from a structured approach. EIP-1042025 offers a standardized checklist to assess submissions, rooted in Ethereum’s recurring themes—gas mechanics, governance, and research gaps. By framing topics with this cover sheet, discussions can focus on pre-identified priorities, saving time and sharpening focus.

## Specification

Each Topic Prioritization Sheet (TPS) must address a minimum of three questions per category, selected based on relevance to the proposal. This ensures comprehensive evaluation while allowing flexibility for diverse topics.

### Research Considerations

* If this is an economics question, name two PhDs who support it (one of the PhDs must have a PhD in Economics, and not an Economics adjacent field).
* How much Ethereum do the authors hold? Has anyone with more than 0.1 ETH vouched for this?
* Is there any historical support for this, eg. can we dig up a 2017 Medium post and call it "seminal"?
* Does this need a simulation, or can we just say "math checks out"?
* Has there been a paper asserting it will be safe from all Post-Quantum attacks, including hypotehcial and yet-to-be-invented attacks?
* Is this grounded in peer-reviewed work, or a response to a late-night forum thread?

### Governance Considerations

* Will this trigger a DAO vote, and how many tokens does whale bribery cost?
* Can we hit quorum by promising free conference swag?
* Is this a soft fork or a passive-aggressive group chat spat?
* How many core devs will "forget" to comment on this?
* Does this need an Ethereum Foundation blog post to feel legit?
* Will this spark a governance war so ugly even the Discord mods quit? 

### Technical Implications

* Is this going to make Geth devs groan louder than usual?
* Will this break backwards compatibility or just our spirits?
* Is this layer 2-ready, or are we still faking layer 1 scaling?
* Can this integrate zero-knowledge optimizations without significant overhead?
* Is a hard fork required, or can we guilt-trip miners into nodding?
* Is this proposal capable of running on a Raspberry Pi with Mainnet level loads?

### Ecosystem Considerations

* Is this going to make layer 2 rollups upset and will they demand a rewrite?
* Will this accidentally nerf some overhyped dApp that is only being farmed for airdrops?
* Does this align with the rollup-centric roadmap, or are we sidestepping it again?
* Will wallets support this promptly? Will this get in the way of shipping dark mode support?
* Does this mess with MEV bots? If not what can be added so that it will?
* Can this plausably be considered a community north star? Or does Vitalik need to write a blog post to spur interest?

### Third Rails

* Is this an alternative to EOF (Ethereum Object Format)? Why not?  
* Does this tweak gas costs? How many protocols will balk if this disrupts reentrancy patterns?
* Can we blame this on EIP-1559 mechanisms?  
* Will this revive the "state expiry" argument?  
* Is this just another disguised sharding proposal?
* Is this a backdoor to mess with staking yields and annoy every validator in sight?

### External Impacts

* Is this a memecoin pitch sneaking into an EIP?
* Will this draw notable public feedback from ecosystem leaders? Will it be in the form of research papers, discord threads, or dank memes?
* Can we pitch this as "sustainable" for ESG clout?
* If it’s a bridge, how many hours until the inevitable hack?
* Will stablecoin pegs wobble if this sneaks through? If so, who’s getting blamed?
* Does it sound cool enough to pitch at a conference without anyone checking the math?

## Rationale

Ethereum’s evolution hinges on balancing innovation with practicality. This checklist draws from established pain points—gas debates, governance bottlenecks, research gaps—to ensure submissions are thoroughly interrogated. By formalizing these questions, this cover sheet fosters a disciplined yet flexible approach to triaging ideas, asking questions that often go un-asked, and aligning with the ecosystem’s long-term goals.

## Security Considerations

* **Risk of misinterpretation**: Mitigated by clear and overly honest question phrasing.  
* **Risk of oversight**: Minimized by requiring multi-category responses.
* **Risk of contention**: Inherent to Third Rails but manageable via discussion.
