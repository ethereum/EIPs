## Abstract

This EIP defines the changes needed to adopt `StableContainer` from [EIP-7495](./eip-7495.md) in consensus data structures.

## Motivation

Ethereum's consensus data structures make heavy use of [Simple Serialize (SSZ)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ef434e87165e9a4c82a99f54ffd4974ae113f732/ssz/simple-serialize.md) `Container`, which defines how they are serialized and merkleized. The merkleization scheme allows application implementations to verify that individual fields (and partial fields) have not been tampered with. This is useful, for example, in smart contracts of decentralized staking pools that wish to verify that participating validators have not been slashed.

While SSZ `Container` defines how data structures are merkleized, the merkleization is prone to change across the different forks. When that happens, e.g., because new features are added or old features get removed, existing verifier implementations need to be updated to be able to continue processing proofs.

`StableContainer`, of [EIP-7495](./eip-7495.md), is a forward compatible alternative that guarantees a forward compatible merkleization scheme. By transitioning consensus data structures to use `StableContainer`, smart contracts that contain verifier logic no longer have to be maintained in lockstep with Ethereum's fork schedule as long as the underlying features that they verify don't change. For example, as long as the concept of slashing is represented using the boolean `slashed` field, existing verifiers will not break when unrelated features get added or removed. This is also true for off-chain verifiers, e.g., in hardware wallets or in operating systems for mobile devices that are on a different software update cadence than Ethereum.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Conversion procedure

For each converted data structure, a new fork agnostic `StableContainer` type `B` is introduced that serves as the primary definition of each data structure.

- Each `StableContainer` is assigned a capacity to represent its potential design space that SHALL NOT change across future forks; if it is later determined that it is insufficient, a new field can be added to contain additional fields in a sub-container.
- The `StableContainer` starts as a copy of the latest fork's `Container` equivalent, except that all field types `T` are wrapped into `Optional[T]`.
- To guarantee forward and backward compatibility, new fields from future forks MUST only be appended to the `StableContainer` definition.
- The type of existing fields MUST NOT change, including the capacity of `List`/`Bitlist`. If a change is necessary, the old field SHALL NOT be used anymore and a new field with a new name SHALL be considered. It is important to anticipate potential future extensions when deciding on the capacities of the `StableContainer` itself and of the various lists.
- For `List`/`Bitlist`, the opportunity SHOULD be used to re-evaluate their design space capacity. If the design space is increased, application logic SHALL check the fork specific length limit; the SSZ library solely defines the merkleization limit, not the serialization limit.
- The conversion process is repeated for each field type. All field types referred to by the `StableContainer` MUST be `StableContainer` themselves, or are considered immutable.

Subsequently, for each `StableContainer` base type `B`, a fork specific `Profile[B]` type is introduced that matches the latest fork's `Container` equivalent. The old `Container` is no longer necessary. The SSZ serialization of `Profile` is compatible with `Container`, but the merkleization and `hash_tree_root` are computed differently. Furthermore, `Profile` MAY use fields of `Optional` type if necessary.

Subsequent forks specify a new `Profile`.

- If new fields of type `T` are added, they are appended to the `StableContainer` as `Optional[T]` to register them with the stable merkleization scheme. In the new fork's `Profile`, the new field MAY be `T` (required), or `Optional[T]` (optional).
- If old fields are deprecated, they are kept in the `StableContainer` to retain the stable merkleization scheme. In the new fork's `Profile`, the field is omitted from the definition. The SSZ library guarantees that `hash_tree_root` and all generalized indices remain the same.
- Other fields MAY be changed between `T` (required) and `Optional[T]` (optional) in the new fork's `Profile`. No changes to the `StableContainer` are required for such changes.

### Immutable types

These types are used as part of the `StableContainer` definitions, and, as they are not `StableContainer` themselves, are considered to have immutable Merkleization. If a future fork requires changing these types in an incompatible way, a new type SHALL be defined and assigned a new field name.

### Fork-specific `Profile` definitions

The consensus type definitions specific to the fork that introduces this EIP are updated to inherit the Merkleization of the `StableContainer` definitions. Fields are kept as is.

```python
class Attestation(Profile[StableAttestation]):
    ...

class IndexedAttestation(Profile[StableIndexedAttestation]):
    ...

class ExecutionPayload(Profile[StableExecutionPayload]):
    ...

class ExecutionPayloadHeader(Profile[StableExecutionPayloadHeader]):
    ...

class ExecutionRequests(Profile[StableExecutionRequests]):
    ...

class BeaconBlockBody(Profile[StableBeaconBlockBody]):
    ...

class BeaconState(Profile[StableBeaconState]):
    ...
```

## Rationale

### Best timing?

Applying this EIP breaks `hash_tree_root` and Merkle tree verifiers a single time, while promising forward compatibility from the fork going forward. It is best to apply it before merkleization would be broken by different changes. Merkleization is broken by a `Container` reaching a new power of 2 in its number of fields.

### Can this be applied retroactively?

While `Profile` serializes in the same way as the legacy `Container`, the merkleization and `hash_tree_root` of affected data structures changes. Therefore, verifiers that wish to process Merkle proofs of legacy variants still need to support the corresponding legacy schemes.

### Immutability

Once a field in a `StableContainer` has been published, its name can no longer be used to represent a different type in the future. This includes list types with a higher capacity than originally intended. This is in line with historical management of certain cases:

- Phase0: `BeaconState` contained `previous_epoch_attestations` / `current_epoch_attestations`
- Altair: `BeaconState` replaced these fields with `previous_epoch_participation` / `current_epoch_participation`

Furthermore, new fields have to be appended at the end of `StableContainer`. This is in line with historical management of other cases:

- Capella appended `historical_summaries` to `BeaconState` instead of squeezing the new field next to `historical_roots`

With `StableContainer`, stable Merkleization requires these rules to become strict.

## Backwards Compatibility

Existing Merkle proof verifiers need to be updated to support the new Merkle tree shape. This includes verifiers in smart contracts on different blockchains and verifiers in hardware wallets, if applicable.

Note that backwards compatibility is also broken when one of the converted `Container` data structures would reach a new power of 2 in its number of fields.
