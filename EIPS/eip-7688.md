## Abstract

This EIP defines the changes needed to adopt `ProgressiveContainer` from [EIP-7495](./eip-7495.md) and `ProgressiveList` from [EIP-7916](./eip-7916.md) in consensus data structures.

## Motivation

Ethereum's consensus data structures make heavy use of [Simple Serialize (SSZ)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/b5c3b619887c7850a8c1d3540b471092be73ad84/ssz/simple-serialize.md) `Container`, which defines how they are serialized and merkleized. The merkleization scheme allows application implementations to verify that individual fields (and partial fields) have not been tampered with. This is useful, for example, in smart contracts of decentralized staking pools that wish to verify that participating validators have not been slashed.

While SSZ `Container` defines how data structures are merkleized, the merkleization is prone to change across the different forks. When that happens, e.g., because new features are added or old features get removed, existing verifier implementations need to be updated to be able to continue processing proofs.

`ProgressiveContainer`, of [EIP-7495](./eip-7495.md), is a forward compatible alternative that guarantees a forward compatible merkleization scheme. By transitioning consensus data structures to use `ProgressiveContainer`, smart contracts that contain verifier logic no longer have to be maintained in lockstep with Ethereum's fork schedule as long as the underlying features that they verify don't change. For example, as long as the concept of slashing is represented using the boolean `slashed` field, existing verifiers will not break when unrelated features get added or removed. This is also true for off-chain verifiers, e.g., in hardware wallets or in operating systems for mobile devices that are on a different software update cadence than Ethereum.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### `Container` conversion

`Container` types that are expected to evolve over forks SHALL be redefined as `ProgressiveContainer[active_fields=[1] * len(type.fields())]`.

For example, given a type in the old fork:

```python
class Foo(Container):
    a: uint8
    b: uint16
```

This type can be converted to support stable Merkleization in the new fork:

```python
class Foo(ProgressiveContainer[active_fields=[1, 1]]):
    a: uint8
    b: uint16
```

As part of the conversion, a stable [generalized index (gindex)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/b5c3b619887c7850a8c1d3540b471092be73ad84/ssz/merkle-proofs.md#generalized-merkle-tree-index) is assigned to each field that remains valid in future forks.

- If a fork appends a field, `active_fields` MUST be extended with a trailing `1`.
- If a fork removes a field, the corresponding `active_fields` bit MUST be changed to `0`.
- Compatibility rules SHOULD be enforced, e.g., by defining a `CompatibleUnion[fork_1.Foo, fork_2.Foo, fork_3.Foo, ...]` type in the unit test framework.

### `List[type, N]` / `Bitlist` conversion

`List` types frequently have been defined with excessively large capacities `N` with the intention that `N` is never reached in practice. In other cases, the capacity itself has changed over time.

- `List` types with dynamic or unbounded capacity semantics SHALL be redefined as `ProgressiveList[type]`, and the application logic SHALL be updated to check for an appropriate limit at runtime.
- `Bitlist` types with dynamic or unbounded capacity semantics SHALL be redefined as `ProgressiveBitlist`

As part of the conversion, a stable [generalized index (gindex)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/b5c3b619887c7850a8c1d3540b471092be73ad84/ssz/merkle-proofs.md#generalized-merkle-tree-index) is assigned to each list element that remains valid regardless of the number of added elements.

### Converted types

The following types SHALL be converted to `ProgressiveContainer`:

- [`Attestation`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/b5c3b619887c7850a8c1d3540b471092be73ad84/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#attestation)
  - The `aggregation_bits` field is redefined to use `ProgressiveBitlist`
- [`IndexedAttestation`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/b5c3b619887c7850a8c1d3540b471092be73ad84/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#indexedattestation)
  - The `attesting_indices` field is redefined to use `ProgressiveList`

  - The `transactions` and `withdrawals` fields are redefined to use `ProgressiveList`
- [`ExecutionPayloadHeader`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/b5c3b619887c7850a8c1d3540b471092be73ad84/specs/deneb/beacon-chain.md#executionpayloadheader)
- [`ExecutionRequests`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/b5c3b619887c7850a8c1d3540b471092be73ad84/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#executionrequests)
  - The `deposits`, `withdrawals` and `consolidation` fields are redefined to use `ProgressiveList`
- [`BeaconBlockBody`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/b5c3b619887c7850a8c1d3540b471092be73ad84/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#beaconblockbody)
  - The `proposer_slashings`, `attester_slashings`, `attestations`, `deposits`, `voluntary_exits`, `bls_to_execution_changes` and `blob_kzg_commitments` fields are redefined to use `ProgressiveList`
- [`BeaconState`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/b5c3b619887c7850a8c1d3540b471092be73ad84/specs/electra/beacon-chain.md#beaconstate)
  - The `validators`, `balances`, `previous_epoch_participation`, `current_epoch_participation`, `inactivity_scores`, `pending_deposits`, `pending_partial_withdrawals` and `pending_consolidations` fields are redefined to use `ProgressiveList`

### Immutable types

These types are used as part of the `ProgressiveContainer` definitions, and, as they are not `ProgressiveContainer` themselves, are considered to have immutable Merkleization. If a future fork requires changing these types in an incompatible way, a new type SHALL be defined and assigned a new field name.

## Rationale

### Best timing?

Applying this EIP breaks `hash_tree_root` and Merkle tree verifiers a single time, while promising forward compatibility from the fork going forward. It is best to apply it before merkleization would be broken by different changes. Merkleization is broken by a `Container` reaching a new power of 2 in its number of fields.

### Can this be applied retroactively?

While `Profile` serializes in the same way as the legacy `Container`, the merkleization and `hash_tree_root` of affected data structures changes. Therefore, verifiers that wish to process Merkle proofs of legacy variants still need to support the corresponding legacy schemes.

### Immutability

Once a field in a `ProgressiveContainer` has been published, its name can no longer be used to represent a different type in the future. This is in line with historical management of certain cases:

- Phase0: `BeaconState` contained `previous_epoch_attestations` / `current_epoch_attestations`
- Altair: `BeaconState` replaced these fields with `previous_epoch_participation` / `current_epoch_participation`

Furthermore, new fields have to be appended at the end of `ProgressiveContainer`. This is in line with historical management of other cases:

- Capella appended `historical_summaries` to `BeaconState` instead of squeezing the new field next to `historical_roots`

With `ProgressiveContainer`, stable Merkleization requires these rules to become strict.

### Cleanup opportunity

Several fields in the `BeaconState` are no longer relevant in current specification versions.

- The `eth1_data`, `eth1_data_votes`, `eth1_deposit_index` and `deposit_requests_start_index` fields could be dropped as they are no longer needed post Fulu.
- `historical_summaries` could be redefined to use `ProgressiveList` and also integrate the historical `historical_roots` data by merging in full `HistoricalSummary` data from an archive (`historical_root` is frozen since Capella), simplifying access to historical block and state roots.

### `BeaconBlockHeader`?

Updating the `BeaconBlockHeader` to `ProgressiveContainer` is tricky as is breaks `hash_tree_root(latest_block_header)` in the `BeaconState`. One option could be to store `latest_block_header_root` separately, possibly also incorporating the block proposer signature into the hash to avoid proposer signature checks while backfilling historical blocks.

### `Validator`?

Updating the `Validator` to `ProgressiveContainer` would add an extra hash for each validator; validators are mostly immutable so rarely need rehashing. Due to the large hash count, implementations may have to incrementally construct the new `Validator` entries ahead of the fork. It should be evaluated whether the hashing overhead is worth a clean transition to future fields, e.g., for holding postquantum keys.

## Backwards Compatibility

Existing Merkle proof verifiers need to be updated to support the new Merkle tree shape. This includes verifiers in smart contracts on different blockchains and verifiers in hardware wallets, if applicable.
