## Simple Summary

This EIP defines standard interfaces and behaviors for token contracts.

## Abstract

This standard defines a new way to interact with a token contract while remaining backward compatible with [ERC-20][].

It defines advanced features to interact with tokens. Namely, *operators* to send tokens on behalf of another address&mdash;contract or regular account&mdash;and send/receive *hooks* to offer token holders more control over their tokens.

It takes advantage of [ERC-1820][] to find out whether and where to notify contracts and regular addresses when they receive tokens as well as to allow compatibility with already-deployed contracts.

## Motivation

This standard tries to improve upon the widely used [ERC-20][] token standard. The main advantages of this standard are:

1. Uses the same philosophy as Ether in that tokens are sent with `send(dest, value, data)`.

2. Both contracts and regular addresses can control and reject which token they send by registering a `tokensToSend` hook. (Rejection is done by `revert`ing in the hook function.)

3. Both contracts and regular addresses can control and reject which token they receive by registering a `tokensReceived` hook. (Rejection is done by `revert`ing in the hook function.)

4. The `tokensReceived` hook allows to send tokens to a contract and notify it in a single transaction, unlike [ERC-20][] which requires a double call (`approve`/`transferFrom`) to achieve this.

5. The holder can "authorize" and "revoke" operators which can send tokens on their behalf. These operators are intended to be verified contracts such as an exchange, a cheque processor or an automatic charging system.

6. Every token transaction contains `data` and `operatorData` bytes fields to be used freely to pass data from the holder and the operator, respectively.

7. It is backward compatible with wallets that do not contain the `tokensReceived` hook function by deploying a proxy contract implementing the `tokensReceived` hook for the wallet.

## Specification

### ERC777Token (Token Contract)

``` solidity
interface ERC777Token {
    function name() external view returns (string memory);
    function symbol() external view returns (string memory);
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address holder) external view returns (uint256);
    function granularity() external view returns (uint256);

    function defaultOperators() external view returns (address[] memory);
    function isOperatorFor(
        address operator,
        address holder
    ) external view returns (bool);
    function authorizeOperator(address operator) external;
    function revokeOperator(address operator) external;

    function send(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;
    function operatorSend(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata data,
        bytes calldata operatorData
    ) external;

    function burn(uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;
    function operatorBurn(
        address from,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata data,
        bytes calldata operatorData
    ) external;

    event Sent(
        address indexed operator,
        address indexed from,
        address indexed to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes data,
        bytes operatorData
    );
    event Minted(
        address indexed operator,
        address indexed to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes data,
        bytes operatorData
    );
    event Burned(
        address indexed operator,
        address indexed from,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes data,
        bytes operatorData
    );
    event AuthorizedOperator(
        address indexed operator,
        address indexed holder
    );
    event RevokedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed holder);
}
```
The token contract MUST implement the above interface. The implementation MUST follow the specifications described below.

The token contract MUST register the `ERC777Token` interface with its own address via [ERC-1820][].

> This is done by calling the `setInterfaceImplementer` function on the [ERC-1820][] registry with the token contract address as both the address and the implementer and the `keccak256` hash of `ERC777Token` (`0xac7fbab5f54a3ca8194167523c6753bfeb96a445279294b6125b68cce2177054`) as the interface hash.

If the contract has a switch to enable or disable ERC777 functions, every time the switch is triggered, the token MUST register or unregister the `ERC777Token` interface for its own address accordingly via ERC1820. Unregistering implies calling the `setInterfaceImplementer` with the token contract address as the address, the `keccak256` hash of `ERC777Token` as the interface hash and `0x0` as the implementer. (See [Set An Interface For An Address][erc1820-set] in [ERC-1820][] for more details.)

When interacting with the token contract, all amounts and balances MUST be unsigned integers. I.e. internally, all values are stored as a denomination of 1E-18 of a token. The display denomination&mdash;to display any amount to the end user&mdash;MUST be 10<sup>18</sup> of the internal denomination.

In other words, the internal denomination is similar to a wei and the display denomination is similar to an ether. It is equivalent to an [ERC-20][]'s `decimals` function returning `18`. E.g. if a token contract returns a balance of `500,000,000,000,000,000` (0.5&times;10<sup>18</sup>) for a user, the user interface MUST show `0.5` tokens to the user. If the user wishes to send `0.3` tokens, the contract MUST be called with an amount of `300,000,000,000,000,000` (0.3&times;10<sup>18</sup>).

User Interfaces which are generated programmatically from the ABI of the token contract MAY use and display the internal denomination. But this MUST be made clear, for example by displaying the `uint256` type.

#### **View Functions**

The `view` functions detailed below MUST be implemented.

**`name` function**

``` solidity
function name() external view returns (string memory)
```

Get the name of the token, e.g., `"MyToken"`.

> <small>**identifier:** `06fdde03`</small>  
> <small>**returns:** Name of the token.</small>

**`symbol` function**

``` solidity
function symbol() external view returns (string memory)
```

Get the symbol of the token, e.g., `"MYT"`.

> <small>**identifier:** `95d89b41`</small>  
> <small>**returns:** Symbol of the token.</small>

**`totalSupply` function**

``` solidity
function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256)
```

Get the total number of minted tokens.

*NOTE*: The total supply MUST be equal to the sum of the balances of all addresses&mdash;as returned by the `balanceOf` function.

*NOTE*: The total supply MUST be equal to the sum of all the minted tokens as defined in all the `Minted` events minus the sum of all the burned tokens as defined in all the `Burned` events.

> <small>**identifier:** `18160ddd`</small>  
> <small>**returns:** Total supply of tokens currently in circulation.</small>

**`balanceOf` function**

``` solidity
function balanceOf(address holder) external view returns (uint256)
```

Get the balance of the account with address `holder`.

The balance MUST be zero (`0`) or higher.

> <small>**identifier:** `70a08231`</small>  
> <small>**parameters**</small>  
> <small>`holder`: Address for which the balance is returned.</small>
> 
> <small>**returns:** Amount of tokens held by `holder` in the token contract.</small>

**`granularity` function**

``` solidity
function granularity() external view returns (uint256)
```

Get the smallest part of the token that's not divisible.

In other words, the granularity is the smallest amount of tokens (in the internal denomination) which MAY be minted, sent or burned at any time.

The following rules MUST be applied regarding the *granularity*:

- The *granularity* value MUST be set at creation time.

- The *granularity* value MUST NOT be changed, ever.

- The *granularity* value MUST be greater than or equal to `1`.

- All balances MUST be a multiple of the granularity.

- Any amount of tokens (in the internal denomination) minted, sent or burned MUST be a multiple of the *granularity* value.

- Any operation that would result in a balance that's not a multiple of the *granularity* value MUST be considered invalid, and the transaction MUST `revert`.

*NOTE*: Most tokens SHOULD be fully partition-able. I.e., this function SHOULD return `1` unless there is a good reason for not allowing any fraction of the token.

> <small>**identifier:** `556f0dc7`</small>  
> <small>**returns:** The smallest non-divisible part of the token.</small>

*NOTE*: [`defaultOperators`][defaultOperators] and [`isOperatorFor`][isOperatorFor] are also `view` functions, defined under the [operators][] for consistency.

*[ERC-20][] compatibility requirement*:  
The decimals of the token MUST always be `18`. For a *pure* ERC777 token the [ERC-20][] `decimals` function is OPTIONAL, and its existence SHALL NOT be relied upon when interacting with the token contract. (The decimal value of `18` is implied.) For an [ERC-20][] compatible token, the `decimals` function is REQUIRED and MUST return `18`. (In [ERC-20][], the `decimals` function is OPTIONAL. If the function is not present, the `decimals` value is not clearly defined and may be assumed to be `0`. Hence for compatibility reasons, `decimals` MUST be implemented for [ERC-20][] compatible tokens.)

#### **Operators**

An `operator` is an address which is allowed to send and burn tokens on behalf of some *holder*.

When an address becomes an *operator* for a *holder*, an `AuthorizedOperator` event MUST be emitted. The `AuthorizedOperator`'s `operator` (topic 1) and `holder` (topic 2) MUST be the addresses of the *operator* and the *holder* respectively.

When a *holder* revokes an *operator*, a `RevokedOperator` event MUST be emitted. The `RevokedOperator`'s `operator` (topic 1) and `holder` (topic 2) MUST be the addresses of the *operator* and the *holder* respectively.

*NOTE*: A *holder* MAY have multiple *operators* at the same time.

The token MAY define *default operators*. A *default operator* is an implicitly authorized *operator* for all *holders*. `AuthorizedOperator` events MUST NOT be emitted when defining the *default operators*. The rules below apply to *default operators*:

- The token contract MUST define *default operators* at creation time.

- The *default operators* MUST be invariants. I.e., the token contract MUST NOT add or remove *default operators* ever.

- `AuthorizedOperator` events MUST NOT be emitted when defining *default operators*.

- A *holder* MUST be allowed to revoke a *default operator* (unless the *holder* is the *default operator* in question).

- A *holder* MUST be allowed to re-authorize a previously revoked *default operator*.

- When a *default operator* is explicitly authorized or revoked for a specific *holder*, an `AuthorizedOperator` or `RevokedOperator` event (respectively) MUST be emitted.

The following rules apply to any *operator*:

- An address MUST always be an *operator* for itself. Hence an address MUST NOT ever be revoked as its own *operator*.

- If an address is an *operator* for a *holder*, `isOperatorFor` MUST return `true`.

- If an address is not an *operator* for a *holder*, `isOperatorFor` MUST return `false`.

- The token contract MUST emit an `AuthorizedOperator` event with the correct values when a *holder* authorizes an address as its *operator* as defined in the [`AuthorizedOperator` Event][authorizedoperator].

- The token contract MUST emit a `RevokedOperator` event with the correct values when a *holder* revokes an address as its *operator* as defined in the [`RevokedOperator` Event][revokedoperator].

*NOTE*: A *holder* MAY authorize an already authorized *operator*. An `AuthorizedOperator` MUST be emitted each time.

*NOTE*: A *holder* MAY revoke an already revoked *operator*. A `RevokedOperator` MUST be emitted each time.

**`AuthorizedOperator` event** <a id="authorizedoperator"></a>

``` solidity
event AuthorizedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed holder)
```

Indicates the authorization of `operator` as an *operator* for `holder`.

*NOTE*: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside of an *operator* authorization process.

> <small>**parameters**</small>  
> <small>`operator`: Address which became an *operator* of `holder`.</small>  
> <small>`holder`: Address of a *holder* which authorized the `operator` address as an *operator*.</small>

**`RevokedOperator` event** <a id="revokedoperator"></a>

``` solidity
event RevokedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed holder)
```

Indicates the revocation of `operator` as an *operator* for `holder`.

*NOTE*: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside of an *operator* revocation process.

> <small>**parameters**</small>  
> <small>`operator`: Address which was revoked as an *operator* of `holder`.</small>  
> <small>`holder`: Address of a *holder* which revoked the `operator` address as an *operator*.</small>

The `defaultOperators`, `authorizeOperator`, `revokeOperator` and `isOperatorFor` functions described below MUST be implemented to manage *operators*. Token contracts MAY implement other functions to manage *operators*.

**`defaultOperators` function** <a id="defaultOperators"></a>

``` solidity
function defaultOperators() external view returns (address[] memory)
```

Get the list of *default operators* as defined by the token contract.

*NOTE*: If the token contract does not have any *default operators*, this function MUST return an empty list.

>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       The principal intent for this standard is to solve some of the shortcomings of <a href="./eip-20.md" lbb="2" fo="2">ERC-20</a> while maintaining backward compatibility with <a href="./eip-20.md" lbb="2" fo="2">ERC-20</a>, and avoiding the problems and vulnerabilities of <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223" fo="16">EIP-223</a>.
>     </p>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       Below are the rationales for the decisions regarding the main aspects of the standards.

>       <em x-id="3">NOTE</em>: Jacques Dafflon (<a href="https://github.com/0xjac" fo="10">0xjac</a>), one of the authors of the standard, conjointly wrote his <a href="https://github.com/0xjac/master-thesis" fo="12">master thesis</a> on the standard, which goes in more details than could reasonably fit directly within the standard, and can provide further clarifications regarding certain aspects or decisions.

>       Lifecycle
>     </h3>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       More than just sending tokens, <a href="./eip-777.md" fo="5">ERC-777</a> defines the entire lifecycle of a token, starting with the minting process, followed by the sending process and terminating with the burn process.
>     </p>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       Having a lifecycle clearly defined is important for consistency and accuracy, especially when value is derived from scarcity. In contrast when looking at some <a href="./eip-20.md" lbb="2" fo="2">ERC-20</a> tokens, a discrepancy can be observed between the value returned by the <code>totalSupply</code> and the actual circulating supply, as the standard does not clearly define a process to create and destroy tokens.

>       Data
>     </h3>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       The mint, send and burn processes can all make use of a <code>data</code> and <code>operatorData</code> fields which are passed to any movement (mint, send or burn). Those fields may be empty for simple use cases, or they may contain valuable information related to the movement of tokens, similar to information attached to a bank transfer by the sender or the bank itself.

>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       The use of a <code>data</code> field is equally present in other standard proposals such as <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223" fo="16">EIP-223</a>, and was requested by multiple members of the community who reviewed this standard.

>       Hooks
>     </h3>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       In most cases, <a href="./eip-20.md" lbb="2" fo="2">ERC-20</a> requires two calls to safely transfer tokens to a contract without locking them. A call from the sender, using the <code>approve</code> function and a call from the recipient using <code>transferFrom</code>. Furthermore, this requires extra communication between the parties which is not clearly defined. Finally, holders can get confused between <code>transfer</code> and <code>approve</code>/<code>transferFrom</code>. Using the former to transfer tokens to a contract will most likely result in locked tokens.
>     </p>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       Hooks allow streamlining of the sending process and offer a single way to send tokens to any recipient. Thanks to the <code>tokensReceived</code> hook, contracts are able to react and prevent locking tokens upon reception.

>       <strong x-id="1">Greater Control For Holders</strong>
>     </h4>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       The <code>tokensReceived</code> hook also allows holders to reject the reception of some tokens. This gives greater control to holders who can accept or reject incoming tokens based on some parameters, for example located in the <code>data</code> or <code>operatorData</code> fields.
>     </p>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       Following the same intentions and based on suggestions from the community, the <code>tokensToSend</code> hook was added to give control over and prevent the movement of outgoing tokens.

>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       The <a href="./eip-1820.md" fo="8">ERC-1820</a> Registry allows holders to register their hooks. Other alternatives were examined beforehand to link hooks and holders.
>     </p>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       The first was for hooks to be defined at the sender's or recipient's address. This approach is similar to <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223" fo="16">EIP-223</a> which proposes a <code>tokenFallback</code> function on recipient contracts to be called when receiving tokens, but improves on it by relying on <a href="./eip-165.md" fo="3">ERC-165</a> for interface detection. While straightforward to implement, this approach imposes several limitations. In particular, the sender and recipient must be contracts in order to provide their implementation of the hooks. Preventing externally owned addresses to benefit from hooks. Existing contracts have a strong probability not to be compatible, as they undoubtedly were unaware and do not define the new hooks. Consequently existing smart contract infrastructure such as multisig wallets which potentially hold large amounts of ether and tokens would need to be migrated to new updated contracts.
>     </p>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       The second approach considered was to use <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/672" fo="4">ERC-672</a> which offered pseudo-introspection for addresses using reverse-ENS. However, this approach relied heavily on ENS, on top of which reverse lookup would need to be implemented. Analysis of this approach promptly revealed a certain degree of complexity and security concerns which would transcend the benefits of approach.
>     </p>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       The third solution&mdash;used in this standard&mdash;is to rely on a unique registry where any address can register the addresses of contracts implementing the hooks on its behalf. This approach has the advantage that externally owned accounts and contracts can benefit from hooks, including existing contracts which can rely on hooks deployed on proxy contracts.
>     </p>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       The decision was made to keep this registry in a separate EIP, as to not over complicate this standard. More importantly, the registry is designed in a flexible fashion, such that other EIPs and smart contract infrastructures can benefit from it for their own use cases, outside the realm of <a href="./eip-777.md" fo="5">ERC-777</a> and tokens. The first proposal for this registry was <a href="./eip-820.md" fo="6">ERC-820</a>. Unfortunately, issues emanating from upgrades in the Solidity language to versions 0.5 and above resulted in a bug in a separated part of the registry, which required changes. This was discovered right after the last call period. Attempts made to avoid creating a separate EIP, such as <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1758" fo="7">ERC820a</a>, were rejected. Hence the standard for the registry used for <a href="./eip-777.md" fo="5">ERC-777</a> became <a href="./eip-1820.md" fo="8">ERC-1820</a>. <a href="./eip-1820.md" fo="8">ERC-1820</a> and <a href="./eip-820.md" fo="6">ERC-820</a> are functionally equivalent. <a href="./eip-1820.md" fo="8">ERC-1820</a> simply contains the fix for newer versions of Solidity.

>       Operators
>     </h3>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       The standard defines the concept of operators as any address which moves tokens. While intuitively every address moves its own tokens, separating the concepts of holder and operator allows for greater flexibility. Primarily, this originates from the fact that the standard defines a mechanism for holders to let other addresses become their operators. Moreover, unlike the approve calls in <a href="./eip-20.md" lbb="2" fo="2">ERC-20</a> where the role of an approved address is not clearly defined, <a href="./eip-777.md" fo="5">ERC-777</a> details the intent of and interactions with operators, including an obligation for operators to be approved, and an irrevocable right for any holder to revoke operators.

>       <strong x-id="1">Default Operators</strong>
>     </h4>
>     
>     <p spaces-before="0">
>       Default operators were added based on community demand for pre-approved operators. That is operators which are approved for all holders by default. For obvious security reasons, the list of default operators is defined at the token contract creation time, and cannot be changed. Any holder still has the right to revoke default operators. One of the obvious advantages of default operators is to allow ether-less movements of tokens. Default operators offer other usability advantages, such as allowing token providers to offer functionality in a modular way, and to reduce the complexity for holders to use features provided through operators.

>       This standard allows the implementation of <a href="./eip-20.md" lbb="2" fo="2">ERC-20</a> functions <code>transfer</code>, <code>transferFrom</code>, <code>approve</code> and <code>allowance</code> alongside to make a token fully compatible with <a href="./eip-20.md" lbb="2" fo="2">ERC-20</a>.

The specification of the <code>view</code> functions (such as <code>name</code>, <code>symbol</code>, <code>balanceOf</code>, <code>totalSupply</code>) and internal data (such as the mapping of balances) overlap without problems. Note however that the following functions are mandatory in <a href="./eip-777.md" fo="5">ERC-777</a> and MUST be implemented: <code>name</code>, <code>symbol</code> <code>balanceOf</code> and <code>totalSupply</code> (<code>decimals</code> is not part of the <a href="./eip-777.md" fo="5">ERC-777</a> standard).

This is done by calling the <code>setInterfaceImplementer</code> function on the ERC1820 registry with the token contract address as both the address and the implementer and the <code>keccak256</code> hash of <code>ERC20Token</code> (<code>0xaea199e31a596269b42cdafd93407f14436db6e4cad65417994c2eb37381e05a</code>) as the interface hash.

>       If the contract has a switch to enable or disable ERC20 functions, every time the switch is triggered, the token MUST register or unregister the <code>ERC20Token</code> interface for its own address accordingly via ERC1820. Unregistering implies calling the <code>setInterfaceImplementer</code> with the token contract address as the address, the <code>keccak256</code> hash of <code>ERC20Token</code> as the interface hash and <code>0x0</code> as the implementer. (See <a href="./eip-1820.md#set-an-interface-for-an-address" f-id="erc1820-set" fo="9">Set An Interface For An Address</a> in <a href="./eip-1820.md" fo="8">ERC-1820</a> for more details.)

Even with an <a href="./eip-20.md" lbb="2" fo="2">ERC-20</a> <code>transfer</code> and <code>transferFrom</code> call, the token contract MUST check via <a href="./eip-1820.md" fo="8">ERC-1820</a> if the <code>from</code> and the <code>to</code> address implement <code>tokensToSend</code> and <code>tokensReceived</code> hook respectively. If any hook is implemented, it MUST be called. Note that when calling <a href="./eip-20.md" lbb="2" fo="2">ERC-20</a> <code>transfer</code> on a contract, if the contract does not implement <code>tokensReceived</code>, the <code>transfer</code> call SHOULD still be accepted even if this means the tokens will probably be locked.
