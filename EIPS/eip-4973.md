## Abstract

Proposes a standard API for account-bound Tokens (ABT) within smart contracts. An ABT is a non-fungible token bound to a single account, and cannot be transferred between accounts. This EIP defines basic functionality to gift, mint, and track ABTs.

## Motivation

The Ethereum community has expressed a need for non-transferrable, non-fungible tokens. Common use cases include tracking an individual's achievements (which can be used as credentials), or items that cannot be transferred (like certain loot in multiplayer online games).

The purpose of this document is to make ABTs a reality on Ethereum by creating consensus around a **maximally backward-compatible** but otherwise **minimal** interface definition.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

`EIP-4973` tokens _must_ implement the interfaces:

- [EIP-165](./eip-165.md)'s `ERC165` (`0x01ffc9a7`)
- [EIP-721](./eip-721.md)'s `ERC721Metadata` (`0x5b5e139f`)

`EIP-4973` tokens _must not_ implement the interfaces:

- [EIP-721](./eip-721.md)'s `ERC721` (`0x80ac58cd`)

See [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md) for a definition of its metadata JSON Schema.

## Rationale

### Interface

`EIP-4973` shall be maximally backward-compatible but still only expose a minimal and simple to implement interface definition.

As [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md) tokens have seen widespread adoption with wallet providers and marketplaces, using its `ERC721Metadata` interface with [`EIP-165`](./eip-165.md) for feature-detection potentially allows implementers to support `EIP-4973` tokens out of the box.

If an implementer of [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md) properly built [`EIP-165`](./eip-165.md)'s `function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID)` function, already by recognizing that [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md)'s track and transfer interface component with the identifier `0x80ac58cd` is not implemented, transferring of a token should not be suggested as a user interface option.

Still, however, since `EIP-4973` supports [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md)'s `ERC721Metadata` extension, an account-bound token should be displayed in wallets and marketplaces with no changes needed.

Although other possible implementations of account-bound tokens are possible, e.g., by having all transfer functions revert, `EIP-4973` is superior as it supports feature detection through [`EIP-165`](./eip-165.md).

### Exception handling

Given the non-transferable between accounts property of ABTs, if a user's keys to an account or a contract get compromised or rotated, a user may lose the ability to associate themselves with the token. In some cases, this can be the desired effect. Therefore, it is suggested to implement re-issuance and potential revocation processes on the issuer side to enable recourse when it is not.

This document is deliberately abstaining from offering a standardized form of exception handling in cases where user keys are compromised or rotated.

In cases where implementers want to make account-bound tokens shareable among different accounts, e.g., to avoid losing access when keys get compromised, we suggest issuing the account-bound token towards a contract's account that implements a multi-signature functionality.

### Provenance Indexing

ABTs can be indexed by tracking the emission of `event Attest` and `event Revoke`. To guarantee reliable and implementation-independent indexable information, neither `event Attest` nor `event Revoke` include a `from` argument to depict the transaction sender. Instead, as a `from` property wouldn't be authenticated and hence opens a security vector, we omit it and advise indexers to substitute it with the transaction-level `from` field which gets authenticated through Ethereum's transaction signature validation prior to inclusion in a block.

## Backwards Compatibility

We have adopted the [`EIP-165`](./eip-165.md) and `ERC721Metadata` functions purposefully to create a high degree of backward compatibility with [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md). We have deliberately used [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md) terminology such as `function ownerOf(...)` to minimize the effort of familiarization for `EIP-4973` implementers already familiar with, e.g., [`EIP-20`](./eip-20.md) or [`EIP-721`](./eip-721.md).
