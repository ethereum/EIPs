## Abstract

This EIP proposes a standard schema for digital receipts of transactions. Digital Receipt Non-Fungible Tokens are issued by a vendor when a customer makes a purchase from their store and contains transaction details necessary for record keeping. Digital Receipt Non-Fungible Tokens extend [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) which allows for the management and ownership of unique tokens.

## Motivation

Purchases from online retailers include a receipt that is emailed and/or physically provided to the customer. These receipts are critical for many reasons but are provided in an analogue form which is difficult to parse by financial systems. Digital receipts have never gained traction dispite the fact that point of sales systems are already digital and the customers often want this information in their own digital systems. So we are left with a redundant Digital -> Analogue -> Digital process which requires unnecessary data entry or the use of clunky receipt-scanning applications.

Digital receipts are relatively simple and can be specified with a schema that can be parsed into JSON or other structured formats. In addition we can prove the receipts validity by digitally signing receipt using the vendors private keys. NFTs provide a unique opportunity to also link the purchaser with a purchased item which is the point of a receipt. 

Cryptocurrency wallets also allow for the attractive feature of clicking through a transaction directly to the receipt, with the wallet being a convenient place for users to track their digital receipts.

Digital receipt as NFTs can also conceptually include other important information such as item serial numbers and delivery tracking etc.

One of the major roadblocks to fully automating our finance world has been the difficulty in tracking transaction details. Human beings physically tracking paper receipts is archaic and NFTs on the blockchain provide a pathway for these systems to be significantly improved.

## Specification

Transaction Flow:
 - A customer purchases an item from an online retailer, checking out leads the customer to an option to mint a NFT.
 - The smart contract provides the user with a Digital Receipt Non-Fungible Token.
 - When fulfilling the order, the retailer will upload the digital receipt specified in in the JSON schema below as the metadata to the previously minted NFT.

### Digital Receipt JSON Schema
The JSON schema is composed of 2 parts. The root schema contains high level details of the receipt (for example Date and Vendor) and another schema for the optionally recurring line items contained in the receipt.

## Rationale

The schema introduced complies with EIP-721's metadata extension, conveniently allowing previous tools for viewing NFTs to show our receipts. The new property "receipt" contains our newly provided receipt structure and the signature property requires the vendor to digitally sign the receipt structure.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is an extension of EIP-721. It is compatible with both optional extensions, Metadata and Enumerable, mentioned in EIP-721.

## Security Considerations

The data stored in the receipt contains personally identifying information. This information should be encrypted to ensure privacy for the customer.

<!-- TODO sean - draft up a separate EIP for the encryption of NFT metadata. -->
