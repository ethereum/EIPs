# Abstract

This EIP defines a compliance-grade, AI-native protocol for ESG-compliant asset tokenization, governed by ATF-AI and protected by post-quantum cryptography.
It codifies lifecycle, metadata, and auditability for compliance-grade deployment, aligns with UN SDGs, and enforces machine-verifiable governance for public, audit-ready markets.

# Motivation

Current tokenization standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155) do not provide out-of-the-box mechanisms for deterministic auditability, ESG alignment, and compliance-first lifecycle controls demanded by institutional environments.
This proposal defines a governance and metadata framework to:
- Enforce lifecycle integrity (issue, audit, retire).
- Guarantee immutable, verifiable, and attestable metadata.
- Enable machine-verifiable attestations under ATF-AI.
- Provide forward security posture with post-quantum readiness.

# Specification

## Metadata Structure

Tokens MUST expose a metadata JSON with the following minimum fields:

```json
{
  "standard": "ERC-ESG/1.0",
  "category": "carbon",
  "geo": "BR-RS",
  "carbon_value": 12.5,
  "cycle": "2025-Q3",
  "digest": "sha3-512:...",
  "physical_id": "seal:XYZ123",
  "attestation": {
    "atf_digest": "sha3-512:...",
    "signer": "did:atf:ai:..."
  },
  "status": "issued|audited|retired",
  "evidence": "cid:Qm..."
}
```

### Interface

Contracts SHOULD implement (Solidity):

```solidity
function mintESGToken(Metadata memory metadata) external;
function auditESGToken(uint256 tokenId) external;
function retireESGToken(uint256 tokenId) external;
function esgURI(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (string memory);
```

### Events

```solidity
event Attested(uint256 indexed tokenId, bytes32 atfDigest, string esgURI);
event Retired(uint256 indexed tokenId, uint256 amount, string reason);
```

### JSON-RPC Example

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_call",
  "params": [
    {
      "to": "0xContractAddress",
      "data": "mintESGToken(encodedMetadata)"
    },
    "latest"
  ]
}
```

### Mapping & Compatibility

- **ERC-20:** Each unit = a standardized fraction (e.g., 1e18 = 1 tCO2e).
- **ERC-721:** Single credit, unique esgURI.
- **ERC-1155:** Homogeneous batch with common URI and amount.

# Rationale

This protocol is designed for compliance-grade and non-speculative deployment.
It enforces deterministic flows, immutable metadata, machine-verifiable audit trails, and compliance-grade governance.
*atfDigest* and *buildDigest* unite off-chain audit with on-chain proof.
The protocol is extensible and avoids hard-forks by using optional interfaces and events.

Within this framework, **AI-Compliance** is defined as:
**AI-Compliance = AI-Governed DAO**

This establishes ATF-AI as a compliance mechanism where governance is executed through an AI-Governed DAO, rather than discretionary human oversight.
It codifies compliance into a machine-verifiable, audit-ready process that remains deterministic across jurisdictions.

# Backwards Compatibility

Does not break ERC-20,721,1155.
Legacy tokens may reference metadata externally but lack full ATF-AI compliance.
Migration tools can wrap legacy tokens with compliant metadata, enabling gradual adoption.

# Test Cases

- Mint token with valid metadata.
- Audit token with ATF-AI digest.
- Retire token and log final audit state.
- Validate physical seal against metadata digest.

# Security Considerations

- Metadata MUST be immutable and cryptographically sealed.
- ATF-AI provides zero-trust validation; all attestations timestamped.
- Digest (SHA3-512) ensures audit integrity.
- Quantum-ready primitives recommended for all bridges.
- Retirement is irreversible; physical seals MUST validate against digest.
- All inputs and off-chain docs MUST be hashed and publicly referenced.

# Reference Implementation

- Crate: agrocrypto-core v2.0.0
- GitHub: agrocrypto-core
- ESG Manifest: ESG-Manifest
- AgroCryptoGit Profile: AgroCryptoGit
- Manifesto: Human+AI (published with hash)
