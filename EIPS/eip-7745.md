## Abstract

Replace the fixed 2048 bit log event bloom filters in block headers with a new data structure that can adapt to the changing number of events per block and consistently guarantee a sufficiently low false positive ratio.

The proposed structure maps all log entries onto a global linear log index space and hashes them into a Merkle tree based on that index. It also contains a _filter map_ for every fixed length section of the log index space, hashed into the same Merkle tree. These are two dimensional sparse bit maps similar to bloom filters that allow searching for log address/topic patterns. Unlike the per-block bloom filters, they allow searching for specific events by accessing only a small portion of the entire dataset which can also be proven with a Merkle proof, making the search both efficient and light client friendly. They also provide exact position information for potential hits. Instead of signaling probable presence in a given block, potential hits derived from a _filter map_ are pointers to the log index space and can be directly used to look up the log at the given index from the Merkle tree of log entries.

The proposed design uses the same structure for efficient local search and remote proof generation/verification, thereby simplifying implementation of provers and verifiers. It also allows validators that are not interested in either searching or proving logs to generate the log index root hash by maintaining a minimal log index state with a relatively small (hard capped) size.

## Motivation

Bloom filters are only useful as long as they are sufficiently sparse. False positive ratio rises rapidly with the number of events per filter and the density of `1` bits in the filter bit vector. In the currently existing bloom filter each log address and topic sets 3 out of a fixed length of 2048 bits which resulted in sufficiently sparse filters in the beginning but with the increase of the block gas limits the false positive ratio soon made the filter practically useless. Mainnet blocks currently add over 1000 log addresses and topics in average and therefore the bloom filter size would need to increase about tenfold in order to achieve acceptable false positive rates again, allowing log search with a proof size of about 3 kilobytes per block which is still kind of expensive.

The main purpose of making logs a part of consensus was to be able to prove these events with a low amount of data and making trustless interaction with smart contracts possible without operating a full node. The _filter maps_ achieve this by sorting events into rows and allowing smaller log range proofs by about 3 orders of magnitude.

## Specification

### Terms and definitions

- _log value_: either an _address value_ or a _topic value_.  Each `LOG` opcode adds one _address value_ and 0..4 _topic values_. A _log value_ is represented by a 32 byte hash which is calculated as `SHA2(address)` or `SHA2(topic)`
- _log index_: values are globally mapped to a linear index space, with a monotonically increasing _log index_ assigned to each added _log value_. The _log values_ are added in the order of EVM execution (_address value_ first, then the _topic values_) so the logs generated in each block and in each transaction of the block occupy a continuous range in the index space. A _block delimiter_ is also added between blocks which has its own _log index_ and is added to the Merkle tree of _log entries_ but not to the _filter maps_.
- _log entry_: an SSZ encoded log event with position metadata (a `LogEntry` container) is added to the `log_entries` Merkle tree at the first _log index_ assigned to the event (the one assigned to the _address value_). The entries at indices assigned to _topic values_ are left empty (a `LogEntry` with all zero fields).
- _block delimiter_: uses the same encoding as regular `LogEntry` containers but is always distinguishable. It is added to the `log_entries` tree before each block and has its own _log index_ assigned.
- _filter map_: a `MAP_WIDTH` by `MAP_HEIGHT` sized sparse map intended to help searching for _log values_ in a fixed `VALUES_PER_MAP` length section of the _log index_ space. Each _log value_ is marked on the map at a row and column that depends on the _log index_ and the _log value_ itself. Rows are sparsely encoded as a list of marked column indices (in the order of occurence, duplicates not filtered out for simplicity). Each map contains at most `VALUES_PER_MAP` marks and therefore the chance of false positives is kept at a constant low level.
- _filter epoch_: a `MAPS_PER_EPOCH` sized group of consecutive filter maps stored in the hash tree in a way so that multiple rows of adjacent _filter maps_ with the same _row index_ can be efficiently retrieved in a single Merkle multiproof. The _log value_ to _row index_ mapping is constant during a single epoch but changes between epochs.

### Consensus data format

#### Block headers

Beginning at the execution timestamp `FORK_TIMESTAMP`, execution clients MUST replace the `logs_bloom` field of the header schema with `log_index_root` which is the root hash of the `LogIndex` structure after adding the logs emitted in the given block.

The resulting RLP encoding of the header is therefore:

```
rlp([
    parent_hash,
    0x1dcc4de8dec75d7aab85b567b6ccd41ad312451b948a7413f0a142fd40d49347, # ommers hash
    coinbase,
    state_root,
    txs_root,
    receipts_root,
    log_index_root,
    0, # difficulty
    number,
    gas_limit,
    gas_used,
    timestamp,
    extradata,
    prev_randao,
    0x0000000000000000, # nonce
    base_fee_per_gas,
    withdrawals_root,
    blob_gas_used,
    excess_blob_gas,
    parent_beacon_block_root,
])
```

#### Container types

```
class LogIndex(Container):
    epochs: Vector[LogIndexEpoch, MAX_EPOCH_HISTORY]
    next_index: uint64                                                # next log index to be added

class LogIndexEpoch(Container):
    filter_maps: Vector[Vector[Bytes32, MAPS_PER_EPOCH], MAP_HEIGHT]  # linear SHA2 hashes of filter map rows, zero for empty/non-existent rows
    log_entries: Vector[LogEntry, MAPS_PER_EPOCH * VALUES_PER_MAP]    # LogEntry containers at the first index of each log event, empty otherwise

class LogEntry(Container):
    log: Log
    meta: LogMeta

class LogMeta(Container):
    block_number: uint64
    transaction_hash: Root
    transaction_index: uint64
    log_in_tx_index: uint64

class Log(Container):
    address: ExecutionAddress
    topics: List[Bytes32, MAX_TOPICS_PER_LOG]
    data: ByteList[MAX_LOG_DATA_SIZE]

class BlockDelimiterEntry(Container):
    dummyLog: Log        # zero address and empty lists
    meta: BlockDelimiterMeta

class BlockDelimiterMeta(Container):
    block_number: uint64
    block_hash: Root
    timestamp: uint64
    dummy_value: uint64  # 2**64-1
```

#### Log entries and block delimiters

Log events with position metadata are added to the `log_entries` tree at the _log index_ assigned to the _address value_ of the log. This allows a simple Merkle proof of all fields of the `eth_getLogs` JSON-RPC response except for the `blockHash` which cannot be hashed into the `log_entries` tree at the time of block processing because the hash of the processed block is not known yet. In order to make `blockHash` provable too a `BlockDelimiterEntry` is added with the parent block's number and hash before adding entries of the next block. This allows the prover to either prove the _block delimiter_ of the same block number as the found _log entry_ or in case of the current head block prove that the last _log entry_ belongs to the same block number.

#### Filter map row encoding

Each row of the filter map is encoded as a series of little endian binary encoded column indices. With the proposed value of `MAP_WIDTH = 2**32` this results in a simple and efficient encoding as a series of 4 byte values. Since the order of entries in this list should not affect the filter algorithm, for simplicity the indices are not sorted but simply appended to the list in the original order of the log events. In the rare case of column index collision (two events generating the same column index in the same row) the index is also added twice. This simplifies the in-memory maintenance of the tree.

Note that the number of indices in a row may vary. The total number of indices in a fully populated _filter map_ is `VALUES_PER_MAP` minus the number of block delimiters which are not marked on the map. Though the average row size is about `VALUES_PER_MAP // MAP_HEIGHT`, the upper limit of individual row length is `VALUES_PER_MAP`. Though such a list could be represented for consensus hashing purposes as `List[Bytes4, VALUES_PER_MAP]` it would just add an unnecessary layer of complexity and extra processing time to tree hash this list since typically the entire row is required for any meaningful search operation. Therefore the rows regardless of their length are simply `SHA2` hashed and the hashes are stored in the consensus tree format.

#### Proposed constants

| Name              | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| MAP_WIDTH         | 2**32 |
| MAP_HEIGHT        | 2**12 |
| VALUES_PER_MAP    | 2**16 |
| MAPS_PER_EPOCH    | 2**6  |
| MAX_EPOCH_HISTORY | 2**24 |

### Initialization and minimal state

Since the Merkle trees are updated with increasing keys, they can be initialized with a Merkle branch of the next leaf to be updated, plus the previous leaf value itself except in case of `log_entries_branch` where this is always zero. Providing `LogIndexMinimalState` on request needs to be added to the sync protocol in order to allow freshly synced nodes to bootstrap. A validator that wants to keep its state minimal and does not want to prove historical log index data can also discard old Merkle tree nodes after update and use this structure as its log index state.

```
class LogIndexMinimalState:
    next_index: uint64                                                                   # next log index to be added
    epoch_branch: Vector[Bytes32, floorlog2(MAX_EPOCH_HISTORY)]                          # merkle branch of the epoch where next_index points
    filter_map_rows: Vector[List[uint32, VALUES_PER_MAP], MAP_HEIGHT]                    # rows of the filter map where next_index points
    filter_map_branches: Vector[Vector[Bytes32, floorlog2(MAPS_PER_EPOCH)], MAP_HEIGHT]  # merkle branches of each row of the filter map where next_index points
    log_entries_branch: Vector[Bytes32, floorlog2(MAPS_PER_EPOCH * VALUES_PER_MAP) + 3]  # merkle branch of log entry where next_index points
```

This structure consists of `floorlog2(MAX_EPOCH_HISTORY)+MAP_HEIGHT*floorlog2(MAPS_PER_EPOCH)+floorlog2(MAPS_PER_EPOCH * VALUES_PER_MAP)` branch hashes and at most `VALUES_PER_MAP` column indices in total. With the proposed constants this amounts to `32*(24+4096*6+6+16)+4*65536 = 1050048` bytes plus encoding overhead.

### Updating the log index

#### Filter map row and column mapping

The log value mapping functions `get_row_index` and `get_column_index` take a _log value_ and its position in the linear index space and return a position of the _filter map_ where a mark for the given _log value_ should be placed.

```
def get_row_index(epoch_index, log_value):
    # epoch_index = log_value_index // VALUES_PER_MAP // MAPS_PER_EPOCH
    return SHA2(log_value + uint32_to_littleEndian(epoch_index)) % MAP_HEIGHT

def get_column_index(log_value_index, log_value):
    value_subindex = log_value_index % VALUES_PER_MAP
    map_index = log_value_index // VALUES_PER_MAP
    transform_hash = SHA2(log_value + uint32_to_littleEndian(map_index))
    return column_transform(value_subindex, transform_hash)
```

The function `column_transform` and its inverse `reverse_transform` realize a quasi-random bijective mapping on the set of integers between `0 .. MAP_WIDTH-1`. They are realized with a series of reversible operations (modulo multiplication with odd numbers, modulo addition, binary XOR) where the second arguments of these operations are taken from different sections of the `transform_hash`. When adding a mark on the _filter map_ the sub-index of the `log value` inside the map (`value_subindex = log_index % VALUES_PER_MAP`) is used as an input for `column_transform`.

```
def column_transform(value_subindex, transform_hash):
    x = value_subindex
    x = (x + littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[0:4])) % 2**32
    x = (x * (littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[4:8])*2+1)) % 2**32
    x = x ^ littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[8:12]
    x = (x * (littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[12:16])*2+1)) % 2**32
    x = (x + littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[16:20])) % 2**32
    x = (x * (littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[20:24])*2+1)) % 2**32
    x = x ^ littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[24:28]
    x = (x * (littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[28:32])*2+1)) % 2**32
    return x

def reverse_transform(column_index, transform_hash):
    x = column_index
    x = (x * modInverse(littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[28:32])*2+1, 2**32)) % 2**32
    x = x ^ littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[24:28]
    x = (x * modInverse(littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[20:24])*2+1, 2**32)) % 2**32
    x = (x + 2**32 - littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[16:20])) % 2**32
    x = (x * modInverse(littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[12:16])*2+1, 2**32)) % 2**32
    x = x ^ littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[8:12]
    x = (x * modInverse(littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[4:8])*2+1, 2**32)) % 2**32
    x = (x + 2**32 - littleEndian_to_uint32(transform_hash[0:4])) % 2**32
    return x
```

Note that with a non-reversible `column_transform` the searcher would need to iterate through the entire `VALUES_PER_MAP` range for each map row and searched log value and check whether there is a mark in the resulting `column_index`, indicating a potential hit. Having a matching `reverse_transform` function makes it possible to just iterate through the actual marked column indices found in the map row and see whether they can be transformed back into a potentially valid `value_subindex` that is less than `VALUES_PER_MAP`:

```
def potential_match_index(map_index, column_index, log_value):
    transform_hash = SHA2(log_value + uint32_to_littleEndian(map_index))
    potential_value_subindex = reverse_transform(column_index, transform_hash)
    if potential_value_subindex < VALUES_PER_MAP:
        return map_index * VALUES_PER_MAP + potential_value_subindex
    return -1
```

#### Block processing

```
# Add all log values emitted in the block to the log index; should be called even if the block is empty
def add_block_logs(log_index, block):
    if block.number > 0:
        # add block delimiter entry
        block_delimiter_meta = BlockDelimiterMeta(block_hash = block.parent_hash, block_number = block.number-1, timestamp = block.parent.timestamp, dummy_value = 2**64-1)
        block_delimiter_entry = BlockDelimiterEntry(meta = block_delimiter_meta)
        log_index.epochs[log_index.next_index // (VALUES_PER_MAP*MAPS_PER_EPOCH)].log_entries[log_index.next_index % (VALUES_PER_MAP*MAPS_PER_EPOCH)] = block_delimiter_entry
        log_index.next_index += 1
    # add log entries and mark log values on filter maps
    for tx_index, receipt in enumerate(block.receipts):
        tx_hash = SHA3(block.transactions[tx_index])
        for log_in_tx_index, log in enumerate(receipt.logs):
            log_meta = LogMeta(transaction_hash = tx_hash, block_number = block.number, transaction_index = tx_index, log_in_tx_index = log_in_tx_index)
            log_entry = LogEntry(meta = log_meta, log = log)
            log_index.epochs[log_index.next_index // (VALUES_PER_MAP*MAPS_PER_EPOCH)].log_entries[log_index.next_index % (VALUES_PER_MAP*MAPS_PER_EPOCH)] = log_entry
            add_log_value(log_index, address_value(log.address))
            for topic in log.topics:
                add_log_value(log_index, topic_value(topic))
    block.log_index_root = hash_tree_root(log_index.root)

# Mark a single log value on the filter maps
def add_log_value(log_index, log_value):
    map_index = log_index.next_index // VALUES_PER_MAP
    epoch_index = map_index // MAPS_PER_EPOCH
    map_subindex = map_index % MAPS_PER_EPOCH
    row_index = get_row_index(epoch_index, log_value)
    column_index = get_column_index(log_index.next_index, log_value)
    log_index.epochs[epoch_index].filter_maps[row_index][map_subindex].append(column_index)
    log_index.next_index += 1

def address_value(address):
    return SHA2(address)

def topic_value(topic):
    return SHA2(topic)
```

## Rationale

### Log index space

In each block a varying number of _log values_ are emitted. In addition to inefficient search, another drawback of per-block fixed size bloom filters is the varying filter utilization leading to over-utilized filters giving many false positives in some blocks and/or wastefully under-utilized filters in some blocks. Block gas limits also tend to change significantly over the long term so any future-proof solution has to be able to adapt to the varying number of _log values_ per block.

Since _filter maps_ of the proposed design are no longer associated with individual blocks but contain filter data from multiple blocks, it is possible to detach them from block boundaries and put a fixed number of _log values_ into each _filter map_. The horizontal mapping realized by `column_transform` and `reverse_transform` ensures that potential hits returned by a search give not only the index of the _filter map_ but the exact _log index_ where the searched _log value_ was probably added and which can be directly used to look up the single log entry from `log_enrties`.

Mapping _log values_ on their own linear index space ensures uniform filter utilization of identically structured _filter maps_. Compared to the alternative of constantly changing adaptive filter size, this approach greatly simplifies the storage and tree hashing scheme and the construction of Merkle multiproofs covering longer block ranges. It also allows mapping each address and topic value separately to consecutive indices and implementing specific address/topic pattern filters.

### Sparse horizontal mapping

False positive rate depends on map density and number of marks placed on the map per log value. It can be estimated as `FALSE_POSITIVE_RATE = (VALUES_PER_MAP * MARKS_PER_VALUE / MAP_WIDTH / MAP_HEIGHT) ** MARKS_PER_VALUE`. The proposed data structure achieves a low false positive rate by choosing a high `MAP_WIDTH` while only adding one mark per value. An alternative would be using multiple marks per _log value_ and a lower `MAP_WIDTH`. With a fixed target `FALSE_POSITIVE_RATE` the necessary `MAP_WIDTH` can be calculated as follows:

```
AVG_MARKS_PER_ROW = VALUES_PER_MAP * MARKS_PER_VALUE / MAP_HEIGHT
MAP_WIDTH = AVG_MARKS_PER_ROW / (FALSE_POSITIVE_RATE ** (1 / MARKS_PER_VALUE))
```

One important factor that depends on map size and marks per value is data efficiency. A wider map requires more bits per mark to encode but also allows less marks per value. A simple way of encoding rows is a binary encoding of each mark column index, requiring `ceil(log2(MAP_WIDTH))` bits per mark. A close to optimal compression of sparse bit vectors is also considered for comparison (formula not detailed here).

```
AVG_BITS_PER_ROW = ceil(log2(MAP_WIDTH)) * AVG_MARKS_PER_ROW
COMPRESSED_AVG_BITS_PER_ROW = (log2(MAP_WIDTH / AVG_MARKS_PER_ROW) + 1.5) * AVG_MARKS_PER_ROW
```

With the following values considered constant, data efficiency depends on `MARKS_PER_VALUE` as follows:

```
VALUES_PER_MAP = 2**16
MAP_HEIGHT = 2**12
FALSE_POSITIVE_RATE = 1 / 2**28
```

| MARKS_PER_VALUE | MAP_WIDTH | AVG_BITS_PER_ROW | COMPRESSED_AVG_BITS_PER_ROW |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------|
|1                |2**32      |512               |472                          |
|2                |2**19      |608               |496                          |
|3                |30964      |720               |520                          |
|4                |2**13      |832               |544                          |

It shows that the smaller encoding of individual mark indices can almost offset the larger number of marks but still, `MARKS_PER_VALUE = 1` results in the best data efficiency when the total size of the filter data set is considered. The advantage of very sparse rows is even greater if we consider the data amount to be accessed when searching for a specific value which requires `MARKS_PER_VALUE` rows to be accessed and matched to each other.

### Log entries tree

Hashing entire logs along with position info into a tree greatly simplifies the remote proving/verifying process. There is no need to separately prove the canonicalness of block headers and the receipts referenced in them, everything can be proven with Merkle proofs of a single `LogIndex` structure.

Storing the `log_entries` subtrees directly in their proposed merkleized format is not really efficient though. This is not an issue for validators that want to maintain a minimal state; for them, updating the `log_entries` subtrees is really cheap as they only need to maintain a single Merkle branch pointing to the next _log index_. Provers can implement `log_entries` efficiently by storing a subset of the Merkle tree nodes (the ones close to the root of each epoch's subtree) and generate the rest on demand based on the receipts that encode the same data in a more compact form. This also requires storing the _log index_ of block delimiters along with reverse pointers pointing to block numbers at the beginning of on-demand generated `log_entries` subtrees.

## Backwards Compatibility

The existing log filter API (`eth_getLogs`, `eth_newFilter`, `eth_getFilterLogs`, `eth_getFilterChanges`) can be implemented with the new filter data structure. Applications relying on this API can operate without any change, with a higher performance. The EVM is not affected in any way.

## Security Considerations

### Safe access with a remote prover

In order to prove a complete set of matches matching a given search pattern in a given block range, the prover needs to

- prove the _log index_ range that corresponds to the searched block number range by proving the _block delimiter_ entries of `first_block - 1` and `last_block`
- prove the relevant rows of filter maps based on map index and row index (verifier can determine the relevant rows in advance based on the _log values_ in the search pattern and the relevant _log index_ range)
- prove the actual _log entry_ belonging to any potentially matching _log index_ and also the _block delimiter_ entry with the same block number if `blockHash` of the log is needed

Since all three steps can be realized with Merkle proofs of the same `LogIndex` structure referenced in the block headers, any search with a remove prover is as safe as the client's knowledge about the most recent available canonical block header.

### False positives

From the filter maps a set of _potential matches_ can be derived for any block range and _log value_ or pattern of _log values_. These matches can then be looked up in the `log_entries` trees and actually matching logs can be added to the set of results. The design guarantees that the set of potential matches includes all actual matches but it should also be ensured that an excessive amount false positives will not make the bandwidth and processing costs of the search prohibitively high.

False positives can happen when `reverse_transform(column_index, transform_hash)` gives a valid `potential_value_subindex` that is less than `VALUES_PER_MAP` while the `column_index` was actually generated by `column_transform(value_subindex, another_transform_hash)` where `another_transform_hash` belongs to a different log value. By assuming a random uniform distribution of column indices the chance of a false positive can be estimated as `VALUES_PER_MAP / MAP_WIDTH = 1 / 2**16` for each mark in the map row. Since each map contains a maximum of `VALUES_PER_MAP` marks, by assuming a random uniform distribution of row indices the rate of false positives can be estimated as `VALUES_PER_MAP^2 / MAP_WIDTH / MAP_HEIGHT = 1 / 2**12` per map or `VALUES_PER_MAP / MAP_WIDTH / MAP_HEIGHT = 1 / 2**28` per individual log value. Assuming `2**11` log values per block this gives a rate of one false positive per `2**17` blocks.

Though certain _log values_ might be emitted a lot more than others and therefore the row index distribution might not be entirely uniform, changing the row mapping per _filter epoch_ ensures that even very often used `log values` will not raise the false positive rate of certain other `log values` over the long term. A deliberate attack on a certain important `log value` in order to raise its false positive rate can not be ruled out entirely since with a low amount of filter data generated per log value it is always possible to "mine" another value that generates colliding filter data. The sparse quasi-randomized horizontal mapping makes this attack a lot harder though, since the column index depends on both the _log value_ and the exact _log index_, making this attack only possible for block creators who are probably offered MEV rewards for much more lucrative manipulations of the transaction set.
