## Abstract
Removing trust from upgradeability proxy is required for anonymous developers. To achieve that, disallowing instant, potentially malicious upgrades is required. This EIP introduces additional storage slots for upgradeability proxy which are assumed to decrease trust in interaction with upgradeable smart contracts. Defined by the admin implementation becomes an active implementation only after Zero Trust Period allows.

## Motivation
It's usually not possible for anonymous developers who uses upgradeability proxies to gain community trust.

Fairer, better future for humanity absolutely requires some developers to stay anonymous while still attract vital attention to solutions they propose and at the same time leverage the benefits of possible upgradeability.

## Specification

The specification is an addition to the standard [EIP-1967](./eip-1967.md) transparent proxy design.
The specification focuses on the slots it adds. All admin interactions with trust minimized proxy must emit an event to make admin actions trackable, and all admin actions must be guarded with `onlyAdmin()` modifier.

### Next Logic Contract Address
Storage slot `0x19e3fabe07b65998b604369d85524946766191ac9434b39e27c424c976493685` (obtained as `bytes32(uint256(keccak256('eip3561.proxy.next.logic')) - 1)`).
Logic address must be first defined as next logic, before it can function as actual logic implementation stored in EIP-1967 `IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT`.
Admin interactions with next logic contract address correspond with these methods and events:
```solidity
// sets next logic contract address and initializes it. Emits NextLogicDefined
// 0x as calldata is an equivalent of proposeTo()
// calldata is ignored here if zero trust period, described below, was already set
function proposeTo(address implementation, bytes calldata data) external onlyAdmin;
// sets the address stored as next implementation as current IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT
// as soon UPGRADE_BLOCK_SLOT allows
function upgrade() external onlyAdmin;
// cancelling is possible for as long as upgrade() for given next logic was not called
// emits NextLogicCanceled
function cancelUpgrade() external onlyAdmin;

event NextLogicDefined(address indexed nextLogic, uint earliestArrivalBlock); // important to have
event NextLogicCanceled(address indexed oldLogic);
```

### Upgrade Block
Storage slot `0xe3228ec3416340815a9ca41bfee1103c47feb764b4f0f4412f5d92df539fe0ee` (obtained as `bytes32(uint256(keccak256('eip3561.proxy.next.logic.block')) - 1)`).
On/after this block next logic contract address can be set to EIP-1967 `IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` or, in other words, start to function as current logic. Updated automatically according to Zero Trust Period, shown as `earliestArrivalBlock` in the event `NextLogicDefined`.

### Propose Block
Storage slot `0x4b50776e56454fad8a52805daac1d9fd77ef59e4f1a053c342aaae5568af1388` (obtained as `bytes32(uint256(keccak256('eip3561.proxy.propose.block')) - 1)`).
Defines after/on which block *proposing* next logic is possible. Required for convenience, for example can be manually set to a year from given time. Can be set to maximum number to completely seal the code.
Admin interactions with this slot correspond with this method and event:
```solidity
function prolongLock(uint b) external onlyAdmin;
event ProposingUpgradesRestrictedUntil(uint block, uint nextProposedLogicEarliestArrival);
```

### Zero Trust Period
Storage slot `0x7913203adedf5aca5386654362047f05edbd30729ae4b0351441c46289146720` (obtained as `bytes32(uint256(keccak256('eip3561.proxy.zero.trust.period')) - 1)`).
Zero Trust Period in amount of blocks, can only be set higher than previous value. While it is at default value(0), the proxy operates exactly as standard EIP-1967 transparent proxy. After zero trust period is set, all above specification is enforced.
Admin interactions with this slot should correspond with this method and event:
```solidity
function setZeroTrustPeriod(uint blocks) external onlyAdmin;
event ZeroTrustPeriodSet(uint blocks);
```

## Rationale
An argument "just don't make such contracts upgadeable at all" fails when it comes to complex systems which do or do not heavily reliant on human factor which might manifest itself in unprecedented ways. It might be impossible to model some systems right on first try. Using decentralized governance for upgrade management coupled with EIP-1967 proxy could also become a serious bottleneck for certain protocols before they mature and data is at hand.

A proxy without a time delay before an actual upgrade is obviously abusable. A time delay is probably unavoidable, even if it means that inexperienced developers might not have confidence using it. Albeit this is a downside of this EIP, it's a critically important option to have in smart contract development today.

Propose block adds to convenience if used, so should be kept.

## Security Considerations
Users must ensure that a trust-minimized proxy they interact with does not allow overflows, ideally represents the exact copy of the code in implementation example above, and also they must ensure that Zero Trust Period length is reasonable(at the very least two weeks if finalized upgrades are usually being revealed beforehand, and in most cases at least a month).
