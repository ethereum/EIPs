**Signal** -
Client intends to participate. *(You are on the bus)*

**Spec** -
Client is satisfied with the proposed specification. *(You agree with the direction)*

**Merge** -
Changes are implemented in the client and configurable for YOLO. *(You are ready to hit the gas and go)*

**Syncing**
Client syncs with the network


## Syncing Instructions
