**Signal** -
Client intends to participate. *(You are on the bus)*

**Spec** -
Client is satisfied with the proposed specification. *(You agree with the direction)*

**Merge** -
Changes are implemented in the client and configurable for YOLO. *(You are ready to hit the gas and go)*

**Syncing**
Client syncs with the network


## Syncing Instructions

**Geth**
- Yolo V1 testnet is up and running https://yolonet.xyz/
- Support is baked into Geth master branch via --yolov1
- Genesis config json is at https://yolonet.xyz/yolo.json
- EF bootnode at enode://9e1096aa59862a6f164994cb5cb16f5124d6c992cdbf4535ff7dea43ea1512afe5448dca9df1b7ab0726129603f1a3336b631e4d7a1a44c94daddd03241587f9@35.178.210.161:30303
- Stats page secret is YOLOv1, with geth you can --ethstats='yournode:YOLOv1@stats.yolonet.xyz'
