## Abstract

Require the bloom filters in an execution block, including at the top level and in the receipt object, to be an empty bytes array.

## Motivation

Logs were originally introduced to give applications a way to record information about onchain events, which decentralized applications (dapps) would be able to easily query. Using bloom filters, dapps would be able to quickly go through the history, identify the few blocks that contained logs relative to their application, and then quickly identify which individual transactions have the logs that they need.

In practice, this mechanism is far too slow. Almost all dapps that access history end up doing so not through RPC calls to an Ethereum node (even a remote-hosted one), but through centralized extra-protocol services.  Not to mention, in a chain with relatively full blocks, the false positive rate in bloom filters has increased to the point of making bloom filters almost useless.

This EIP proposes recognizing that reality, and removing bloom filters from the protocol since it places an unnecessary compute burden on execution clients who are currently computing essentially unused and unusable bloom filters and shipping them around the network. This will become even more acute if or when block level gas limits are increased as is currently being proposed in other EIPs. Applications that need history querying would be encouraged to develop and use decentralized protocols that create provable log indexes using eg. ZK-SNARKs and incrementally-verifiable computation.

## Specification

The `logsBloom` field of the execution block header and the `logsBloom` field of the transaction receipt are now required to be an empty bytes array.

## Rationale

This is a minimally disruptive way to remove the need to compute blooms from clients while not requiring any breaking changes to the RLP encoding for execution blockheaders or transaction receipts.

Gas costs of LOG are not reduced, because while the externality of polluting the bloom filter no longer needs to be accounted for, the costs of hashing have increased due to the needs of ZK-SNARK EVM implementations.

## Backwards Compatibility

Applications that depend on bloom filters to read events will cease to work. Very few applications depend on this feature today, because at current gas limits the false positive rate is so high and processing the logs in a long history query is so slow, especially for light clients (whom this feature was primarily intended to benefit).

## Security Considerations

As no new features are introduced or made cheaper, no security concerns are raised.
