## Abstract

This proposal defines a standard A.P.I. that enables E.V.M. Blockchain-based companies (or also called "Protocols") to publish their financial information, specifically Income Statements and Balance Sheets, on-chain in a transparent and accessible manner through Solidity Smart Contracts. This standard aims to emulate the reporting structure used by publicly traded companies in traditional stocks markets, like the S.E.C. 10-Q filings. The financial statements include key information, namely as Revenue, Cost of Goods Sold, Operating Expenses, Operating Income, Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (E.B.I.T.D.A.) and
Earnings Per Token (E.P.Share-Token), allowing investors to assess the financial health of blockchain-based companies in a standardized, transparent, clear and reliable format.

## Motivation

The motivation of this E.I.P. is to Bring Seriousness to the CryptoCurrencies Investments Market. Currently, the situation is as follows:

Most [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) Tokens representing E.V.M. Blockchain-based companies (or also called "Protocols"), DO NOT work the same way as a Publicly Traded Stock that represents a Share of ownership of the equity of that such company (so the user who buys a Protocol's ERC-20, is also now a share-holder and co-owner of the business, its profits and/or its dividends), but rather function as "Commodities" such as oil; they are consumable items created by said E.V.M. Blockchain-based company (or "Protocol") to be spent in their platform. They are Publicly Traded and advertised to be representing the underlying Protocol like a Share, working in practice the same way as a Commodity and without any Public, Transparent and _Clear_ Financial Information as publicly traded stocks have.

Added to that, most token research analysis reports that can be currently found on the internet are informal Substack or Twitter posts, with lots of abstract explanations about the features of the said Protocol to invest in, that lack of transparent financial numbers and factual financial information, that are made by anonymous users without real exposed reputations to affect.

This E.I.P. will improve that by giving users and investors transparent, clear and factual financial information to work with when analyzing as a potential investment the such
E.V.M. Blockchain-based company that implements this E.I.P. in their Solidity Smart Contracts, and that will generate Trust, Transparency and Seriousness in the CryptoCurrencies Investments Market long term.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

All Transparent Financial Statements Standard implementations MUST implement ERC-20 to represent shares, and the financial numbers displayed in a StableCoin's value.

All Transparent Financial Statements MUST implement ERC-20's optional metadata extensions.
The `name` and `symbol` functions SHOULD reflect the underlying token's `name` and `symbol` in some way.

All methods MUST be of visibility `public`.

All methods MUST return the `stablecoin`.

_Timestamp Constraint_: For all methods, startTimestamp MUST be less than or equal to endTimestamp. If startTimestamp is equal to endTimestamp, the method returns a balance sheet snapshot. If startTimestamp is less than endTimestamp, the method returns an income statement for that period.

_Output Structs_: Instead of a single `uint256` value, each method returns a `Struct` with one or _OPTIONAL_ more `uint256` entries to allow for detailed financial data, each one with their own customized entry `name`.

### Definitions:

- Currency: The individual StableCoin used to value the publicly displayed financial numbers.
- Revenue: Total earnings from selling products or services before expenses.
- Cost of Goods Sold (C.O.G.S.): Direct costs for producing goods/services, including labor and materials.
- Operating Expenses: Expenses like Selling, General, and Administrative, Research and Development, and other operational costs.
- Operating Income: Revenue minus operating expenses.
- E.B.I.T.D.A.: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.
- Other Income and Expenses: Non-operating income, such as interest, investment gains or losses.
- Net Income: Profit after all expenses, taxes, and deductions.
- E.P.S.: Earnings per Share Token (ERC-20), showing profit allocated per share.

## Rationale

The current state of token investment analysis is opaque, with most information presented in an abstract and non-quantitative form. This standard A.P.I. ensures a consistent and reliable way for investors to evaluate blockchain projects based on real financial data published directly on-chain, not just speculative promises. This will establish greater
trust in the cryptocurrency markets and align token analysis with the standards of traditional equity markets.

ERC-20 is enforced because implementation details like Earnings Per Token calculation directly carry over to the accounting. This standardization makes the Transparent Financial Statements compatible with all ERC-20 use cases.

This implementation enables the Protocol to share their financial information both as their latest updated Balance Sheet (if the user chooses to just see a current snapshot of
the financial state of the company) and as an Income Statement (if the user chooses to see the evolution of the financial state of the company between two different block
timestamps) and also is thought to interact with other separated Smart Contracts of the same Protocol from which the financial information will be sent.

## Backwards Compatibility

Transparent Financial Statements Standard is fully backward compatible with the ERC-20 standard and has no known compatibility issues with other standards.

## Security Considerations

This E.I.P. involves displaying critical financial data on-chain, so special attention must be paid to ensure the accuracy and security of the data, particularly in preventing tampering or manipulation of key financial figures. Further discussion on validation mechanisms and audits for the smart contracts containing financial data is necessary.

Needs discussion.
