## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->

A standard interface of tokens for layer 2 solutions which are minted by Casper PEPoW algorithm.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

The following standard is an extended version of ERC20 token for layer-2 solutions using Casper PEPoW. This token is minted by checkpoint proposing and validation to mitigate the data availability problem and provide economic incentives for the operators.

Casper PEPoW uses priority exponential proof of work for its checkpoint proposing rule and Casper FFG for its fork choice rule. In Casper PEPoW, checkpoint proposers are ordered dynamically and have their own difficulties in proposing a new checkpoint. Also, the difficulty of Proof of Work to propose a new checkpoint is exponential to the order of priority. Lastly, the Casper validation reward for a checkpoint is also exponential to its priority.

Moreover, to provide the main-net level security to the 2nd layer, unlike the vanilla Casper FFG, justified checkpoints can be reverted by the challenge system. Any checkpoint, which is justified, but not finalized yet, can get a challenge. If the challenge reverts the justified checkpoint, validators who voted to the checkpoint are all slashed. It makes the conflicting fork being able to be justified. Lastly, to finalize a checkpoint, all of its ancestor checkpoints should not be in dispute.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

When we run a layer 2 solution, the data availability problem is always a hot potato. Furthermore, the operators spend Ether for the gas costs to update the data from the 2nd layer to the 1st layer. To solve these problems, we need to make the operator set more decentralized to mitigate the data availability issue and also need to mint tokens to reward the decentralized operators.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

First, applying a mechanism like Casper FFG to the layer 2 solutions is a good way to offer operators an economic incentive to participate in. And it makes the network more decentralized and resistant to the data unavailability. If we apply Casper FFG to the layer 2 solutions, anyone participates in the operator set without permission and gets rewarded for checkpoint proposing or validation. And if someone submits a checkpoint that does not provide enough data to others, the validators may choose another checkpoint.

Secondly, it is important to use the PEPoW algorithm to make the network more decentralized. PEPoW lets PoW still be useful to mitigate forking and back up the out of network problem with the only small amount of hash power. For example, even if a checkpoint proposer cut in the line by using an extra hash power, the checkpoint may not be chosen by the validators since it does not offer the best reward. As a result, it makes having an obsessive hash power pointless for users to operate a node. Therefore, many users can easily participate as an operator and naturally run their nodes with the standard amount of hash power.


### Mechanism

![legend](../assets/eip-1913/legend.png)

![fig1-3](../assets/eip-1913/fig1-3.png)

- Fig 1) 
  - The first checkpoint is justified and finalized
  - *c2-1* is the first submitted checkpoint, because of its low difficulty.
  - *c2-1* is justified by the validators because it offers the highest reward, for isntance 64 tokens, while *c2-2* offers only 16 tokens.
- Fig 2)
  - The checkpoint *3-1* is not available. Soon after another proposer submitted the checkpoint *c3-2* due to the unavailability.
  - Validators vote to *c3-2* even it is the second priority.
  - As *c3-2* is justified, Casper finalizes *c2-1* and the dynasty becomes 2.
- Fig 3)
  - *c4-1* is submitted and justified, but its state transition is invalid.

![fig4-6](../assets/eip-1913/fig4-6.png)

- Fig 4)
  - One of the operators challenges *c4-1* due to the invalid state transition
  - Because *c4-1* is justified, *c4-2* is not able to be justified due to it is on the conflicting fork.
- Fig 5)
  - The challenge succeeds and the justification for *c4-1* is reverted.
  - As Casper reverts the justification, proposer and validators who voted to *c4-1* gets slashed.
  - As the malicious operators are slashed, *c4-2* becomes able to be justified.
- Fig 6)
  - Any checkpoint can get challenged if it is not finalized.

![fig7-9](../assets/eip-1913/fig7-9.png)

- Fig 7) 
  - Even validators justify the direct child of a justified checkpoint, if there's an ancestor checkpoint in dispute, it does not finalize the parent checkpoint.
  - If *c5-2* was not in dispute, *c6-1* should be finalized.

- Fig 8)
  - Defending a challenge does not affect the finalization of already submitted checkpoints.

- Fig 9)
  - The checkpoint *c7-2* is finalized by the justification of *c8-1*.
  - Postponed finalizations occur at once, so the dynasty becomes 7.



## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->

This standard does not include backward incompatibility. This is compatible with ERC20.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other EIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

[[WIP]https://github.com/wanseob/casper-pepow-token/blob/master/test/CasperToken.test.js](https://github.com/wanseob/casper-pepow-token/blob/master/test/CasperToken.test.js)

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
