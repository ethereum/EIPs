## Abstract

This proposal introduces a standardized validation mechanism for account abstraction using onchain account configurations to define accepted authorizations for an account. Unlike [EIP-7701](./eip-7701.md) and [EIP-8141](./eip-8141.md), which permit arbitrary validation code, this approach restricts validation to predefined auth types, ensuring protocol simplicity and secure account abstraction without EVM execution during validation. A new transaction type leverages this mechanism with native gas abstraction support.

## Motivation

Enable account abstraction benefits—batching, gas sponsorship, custom authentication, programmable logic—while allowing nodes to validate transactions via simple state checks without EVM execution. This enables highly optimizable and performant transaction validation and mempool implementations and removes the need for additional reputation systems to ensure DoS prevention.

Having the account auth configurations accessible and manageable via the EVM enables accounts to build out any additional recovery mechanisms they desire. Calldata delivery to the account address only means the wallet can build out any additional checks for validation they desire.

### Existing Solutions

| Solution | Approach | Limitations |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| ERC-4337 | Application-layer abstraction | Complex mempool rules (ERC-7562), high gas overhead, entrypoint costs |
| [EIP-7701](./eip-7701.md) | Protocol-level with arbitrary validation | Complex mempool rules, major protocol changes, reputation systems |

This proposal addresses these by:

- **Simplifying Validation**: Predefined auth types eliminate EVM execution during validation
- **Optimizable Mempool and Validation Logic**: Validators use only state lookups, mempools can invalidate transactions quickly via (flash)block access lists.
- **Reducing Gas Costs**: No entrypoint contracts or associated overhead for standard transaction flow
- **Ensuring Extensibility**: Supports future quantum-safe algorithms via new auth types, and a `fee_token` field for future token-based gas payment
- **Maintaining Compatibility**: Coexists with [EIP-7702](./eip-7702.md) and ERC-4337

### Account Types

This proposal supports three paths for accounts to use AA transactions:

| Account Type | How It Works | Key Recovery |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Existing Smart Contracts** | Already-deployed accounts (e.g., ERC-4337 wallets) register keys via `authorizeKey()` on the system contract | Wallet-defined |
| **EOAs via [EIP-7702](./eip-7702.md)** | EOAs set delegation to a smart wallet implementation, then register keys | EOA key always authorized |
| **New Accounts (No EOA)** | Deploy via `account_initialization` with CREATE2; keys configured at deployment | Wallet-defined |

**Existing smart contracts** can migrate to native AA without redeployment by registering their signing keys with the system contract.

**EOAs** can adopt AA features by either: (1) using [EIP-7702](./eip-7702.md) to delegate to a smart wallet, or (2) on chains with a configured default account, submitting AA transactions directly.

**New accounts without an EOA** are created via the `account_initialization` field, deploying wallet bytecode and configuring keys in a single transaction.

### Auth Types

| Auth Type | ID | Algorithm | Public Key Size | Signature Size | keyId Derivation |
|----------|-----|-----------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| `K1` | `0x01` | secp256k1 (ECDSA) | 33/65 bytes | 65 bytes | `keccak256(x \|\| y)[12:]` |
| `R1` | `0x02` | secp256r1 / P-256 | 33/65 bytes | 64 bytes | `keccak256(x \|\| y)[12:]` |
| `WEBAUTHN` | `0x03` | WebAuthn / Passkey | 65 bytes | Variable (max 2KB) | `keccak256(x \|\| y)[12:]` |
| `BLS` | `0x04` | BLS12-381 | 48 bytes | 96 bytes | `keccak256(pubkey)[12:]` |
| `DELEGATE` | `0x05` | Delegated validation | 20 bytes (address) | Nested signature | `address` (direct) |

The auth type ID serves as both the stored `auth_type` value and the leading byte in configured key signatures. See [Signature Format](#signature-format) for details. Intrinsic gas costs are defined per auth type in [Intrinsic Gas](#intrinsic-gas).

All cryptographic key types derive `keyId` as the last 20 bytes of `keccak256(public_key_material)`. For K1, R1, and WebAuthn, the input is the uncompressed point `(x, y)` as 64 bytes — for K1 this is the standard Ethereum address, so ecrecover directly returns the keyId and an EOA's own key has `keyId == account address`. R1 and WebAuthn share the same derivation since they use the same curve (P-256); the same physical key has the same keyId regardless of auth type. Cross-type collisions between different key sizes (64, 48, 20 bytes) are prevented by distinct hash inputs. DELEGATE uses the delegated account's address directly as keyId (no hashing), making it a transparent pointer to the target account.

**WebAuthn Gas Calculation**: The `calldata_gas` component charges 16 gas per non-zero byte and 4 gas per zero byte of the WebAuthn signature data (authenticatorData + clientDataJSON). This accounts for variable signature sizes while the 2KB (`MAX_SIGNATURE_SIZE`) cap prevents DoS attacks via oversized signatures.

**DELEGATE**: Delegates validation to another account's configuration. The `keyId` is the delegated account's address directly — a transparent pointer. Only 1 hop is permitted; if the delegated account's signing key is also a `DELEGATE` type, validation fails. See [DELEGATE](#delegate) for signature structure. Note: because K1 keyId derivation produces an Ethereum address, a K1 key authorization and a DELEGATE for the same address are mutually exclusive — they share the same keyId and occupy the same storage slot. These represent different trust models: K1 pins trust to a *specific private key*, while DELEGATE trusts *any key currently authorized on the target account*. DELEGATE subsumes K1 authorization for the same address.

**BLS**: Enables signature aggregation which can be used to reduce data availability costs for rollups and L2s. (Implementation outside of this scope.)

### Account Configuration

Each account can authorize a set of keys through the Account Configuration Contract at `ACCOUNT_CONFIG_ADDRESS`. Keys are identified by their `keyId`, a 20-byte content-derived identifier (see [Auth Types](#auth-types) for per-type derivation).

Only `msg.sender` can modify their own key configuration within EVM execution. Keys can also be modified via portable key changes (see [Cross-Chain Key Changes](#cross-chain-key-changes)).

**Default behavior**: An empty configuration means only the account's EOA key can authorize transactions. The EOA's own key has `keyId == from`, so the protocol checks this directly. The EOA key always retains authorization regardless of configured keys, ensuring recovery capability (for EOA-based accounts). Note that this feature will likely be removed in any sort of quantum migration in a future EIP.

#### Storage Layout

```
Base slot: keccak256(account_address || ACCOUNT_CONFIG_ADDRESS)

Key struct (consecutive slots per keyId):
  keccak256(keyId || base_slot) + 0: auth_type (uint8) — non-zero = authorized
  keccak256(keyId || base_slot) + 1: public_key bytes [0:32]
  keccak256(keyId || base_slot) + 2: public_key bytes [32:] (if > 32 bytes)

Key change sequence:
  keccak256(base_slot || "key_sequence"): latest applied sequence (uint64)
```

The protocol validates signatures by reading these slots directly — no arbitrary EVM execution during validation.

Key enumeration is performed off-chain via `KeyAuthorized` / `KeyRevoked` event logs rather than on-chain storage, eliminating the gas overhead of maintaining an enumeration array. No key count or limit is enforced on-chain—since keys are stored in a content-addressed mapping and validation only reads the specific signing key (O(1)), gas costs naturally bound key creation.

#### 2D Nonce Storage

Nonce state is managed by a separate system contract at `NONCE_MANAGER_ADDRESS`, isolating high-frequency nonce writes from the Account Configuration Contract's key storage (see [Why a Separate Nonce Contract?](#why-a-separate-nonce-contract)).

```
Contract: NONCE_MANAGER_ADDRESS

Base slot: keccak256(account_address || NONCE_MANAGER_ADDRESS)
Nonce slot: base_slot + nonce_key
Value: current_sequence (uint64)
```

The protocol reads and increments nonce slots directly during AA transaction processing. Only the protocol may increment nonces; there is no public `increment` function.

### AA Transaction Type

A new [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) transaction with type `AA_TX_TYPE`:

```
AA_TX_TYPE || rlp([
  chain_id,
  from,               // Sender address (20 bytes) | empty for EOA signature
  nonce_key,          // 2D nonce channel (uint192)
  nonce_sequence,     // Sequence within channel (uint64)
  expiry,             // Unix timestamp or block number 
  max_priority_fee_per_gas,
  max_fee_per_gas,
  gas_limit,
  authorization_list, 
  account_initialization,  // For deploying new accounts if not using 7702 | empty
  key_changes,        // Replayable cross-chain key change operations | empty
  calldata,
  sender_auth,
  fee_token,          // bytes: 0x for ETH, otherwise reserved
  payer_auth          // K1 signature (65 bytes) | empty
])
```

#### Field Definitions

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `chain_id` | Chain ID per [EIP-155](./eip-155.md) |
| `from` | Sending account address. **Required** (non-empty) for configured key signatures. **Empty** for EOA signatures—address recovered via ecrecover. The presence or absence of `from` is the sole distinguisher between EOA and configured key signatures. |
| `nonce_key` | 2D nonce channel key (uint192) for parallel transaction processing |
| `nonce_sequence` | Must equal current sequence for `(from, nonce_key)`. Incremented after inclusion regardless of execution outcome |
| `expiry` | Transaction invalid after this Unix timestamp |
| `max_priority_fee_per_gas` | Priority fee per gas unit ([EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md)) |
| `max_fee_per_gas` | Maximum fee per gas unit ([EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md)) |
| `gas_limit` | Maximum gas |
| `authorization_list` | [EIP-7702](./eip-7702.md) authorization list |
| `account_initialization` | **Empty**: No account deployment. **Non-empty**: See [Account Initialization](#account-initialization) |
| `key_changes` | **Empty**: No key changes. **Non-empty**: Array of signed key change operations. See [Cross-Chain Key Changes](#cross-chain-key-changes) |
| `calldata` | Data delivered to `from` account |
| `sender_auth` | See [Signature Format](#signature-format) |
| `fee_token` | **Empty (0x)**: Gas paid in ETH. **Non-empty**: Reserved for future token payment EIPs |
| `payer_auth` | **65 bytes**: K1 signature, payer recovered via ecrecover. **Empty**: `from` pays ETH |

#### Intrinsic Gas

```
intrinsic_gas = AA_BASE_COST + sender_key_cost + calldata_cost + nonce_key_cost + init_code_cost + key_changes_cost
```

**`sender_key_cost`**: Determined by the auth type byte:

| Auth Type Byte | Auth Type | Gas | Rationale |
|----------------|-----------|-----|-----------|
| EOA | K1 | 6000 | ecrecover (3000) + overhead |
| `0x01` | K1 | 6000 | ecrecover (3000) + 1 SLOAD + overhead (same for both K1 formats) |
| `0x02` | R1 | 7000 | P256 verify + 2-3 SLOADs (auth_type + pubkey) |
| `0x03` | WebAuthn | 12000 + calldata_gas | P256 verify + parsing + 2-3 SLOADs |
| `0x04` | BLS | 8000 | BLS verify + 2 SLOADs |
| `0x05` | DELEGATE | 2100 + delegated | 1 SLOAD + nested sig cost |

K1 uses ecrecover which inherently recovers the keyId — no public key lookup needed. Other cryptographic types require additional reads to retrieve the stored public key. The `calldata_gas` for WebAuthn charges 16 gas per non-zero byte and 4 gas per zero byte of authenticatorData + clientDataJSON.

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `nonce_key_cost` | 22,100 gas for first use of a `nonce_key` (cold SLOAD + SSTORE set), 5,000 gas for existing keys (cold SLOAD + warm SSTORE reset) |
| `init_code_cost` | 0 if `account_initialization` empty. Otherwise: 32,000 (CREATE2 base) + `init_code` calldata gas + code deposit cost (200 gas per deployed byte) |
| `key_changes_cost` | Per applied entry: 5,000 (signature verification) + `num_operations` × 20,000 per SSTORE for key struct slots. Per skipped entry (already applied): 2,100 (SLOAD to check sequence). 0 if `key_changes` empty |

The `nonce_key_cost` ensures 2D nonce channels incur appropriate storage costs in the Nonce Manager contract:

- **New key**: Cold SLOAD (2,100) to check current value + SSTORE set (20,000) for 0→non-zero = 22,100 gas
- **Existing key**: Cold SLOAD (2,100) to read current nonce + warm SSTORE reset (2,900) to increment = 5,000 gas

#### Signature Format

Signature format is determined by the `from` field:

**EOA signature** (`from` empty): Raw 65-byte ECDSA signature `(r || s || v)`. The sender address is recovered via ecrecover.

**Configured key signature** (`from` set):

```
auth_type (1 byte) || [keyId (20 bytes) ||] signature_data
```

| Auth Type | Signature Format | Total Size | Protocol Reads |
|-----------|------------------|------------|----------------|
| `0x01` K1 (recovery) | `r,s,v (65)` | 66 bytes | 1 SLOAD |
| `0x01` K1 (with keyId) | `keyId (20) \|\| r,s,v (65)` | 86 bytes | 1 SLOAD |
| `0x02` R1 | `keyId (20) \|\| r,s (64)` | 85 bytes | 2-3 SLOADs |
| `0x03` WebAuthn | `keyId (20) \|\| authenticator_data \|\| client_data_json \|\| r,s` | Variable | 2-3 SLOADs |
| `0x04` BLS | `keyId (20) \|\| sig (96)` | 117 bytes | 2 SLOADs |
| `0x05` DELEGATE | `delegate_address (20) \|\| nested_signature` | Variable | 1 SLOAD + nested |

Note: K1 supports two formats, disambiguated by length: 65 bytes after the auth type byte is recovery (ecrecover derives keyId), 85 bytes includes an explicit keyId. Both cost the same, and recovery saves 20 bytes of calldata. All other types always include keyId.

##### Validation

1. Parse `auth_type` byte. Derive or parse `keyId` (K1 recovery: ecrecover; all others: read from signature)
2. Read key struct for `(from, keyId)`: verify authorized and stored `auth_type` matches the claimed `auth_type`. For K1 only, `keyId == from` is also valid (EOA default).
3. **K1**: verify ecrecover result matches keyId. **R1/WebAuthn/BLS**: verify signature against stored public key. **DELEGATE**: validate nested signature against delegate account (1 hop max)

##### DELEGATE

For DELEGATE (`0x05`), the `keyId` is the delegated account's address directly. The protocol confirms authorization, then validates `nested_signature` against the delegated account's configuration. Only 1 hop is permitted. Nested signature disambiguation: exactly 65 bytes is a raw EOA signature (ecrecover must match the delegate address); 66+ bytes starts with an auth type byte parsed against the delegated account's config.

**Example** (Account B delegates to Account A, which has an R1 key):

```
0x05 || Account_A_address (20) || 0x02 || A_R1_keyId (20) || r,s (64)
```

#### Signature Payload

Sender and payer use different type bytes for domain separation, preventing signature reuse attacks:

**Sender signature hash**:

The sender signs a marker value in the `payer_auth` position to commit to sponsorship intent:

- `0x80` (RLP empty string): self-pay, no sponsor expected
- `0x00` (placeholder byte): sponsor required, payer will attach `payer_auth` after sender signs

```
// Self-pay (no sponsor):
keccak256(AA_TX_TYPE || rlp([
  chain_id, from, nonce_key, nonce_sequence, expiry,
  max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit,
  authorization_list, account_initialization, key_changes, calldata,
  fee_token, 0x80
]))

// Sponsored (payer required):
keccak256(AA_TX_TYPE || rlp([
  chain_id, from, nonce_key, nonce_sequence, expiry,
  max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit,
  authorization_list, account_initialization, key_changes, calldata,
  fee_token, 0x00
]))
```

**Payer signature hash** (when sponsoring):

```
keccak256(AA_PAYER_TYPE || rlp([
  chain_id, from, nonce_key, nonce_sequence, expiry,
  max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit,
  authorization_list, account_initialization, key_changes, calldata,
  fee_token
]))
```

#### Payer Modes

Gas payment mode is determined by the sender's signed marker in the `payer_auth` hash position:

| Mode | Sender signs | `payer_auth` (wire) | Gas Payer | Description |
|------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Self-pay** | `0x80` (empty) | MUST be empty | `from` | Sender pays gas in ETH. Payer cannot attach. |
| **Sponsored** | `0x00` (placeholder) | 65-byte K1 signature | Payer (ecrecover) | Payer signs authorizing gas payment. |

#### Fee Token Field

The `fee_token` field enables future token-based gas payment mechanisms. In this specification, it MUST be empty bytes (`0x`). When empty, gas is paid in ETH by either the sender (self-pay) or payer (sponsored). Nodes MUST reject transactions where `fee_token` is non-empty until a future EIP defines valid formats.

### Account Initialization

New smart contract accounts can be deployed with pre-configured keys in a single transaction using the `account_initialization` field:

```
account_initialization = rlp([
  user_salt,          // bytes32: User-chosen uniqueness factor
  init_code,          // bytes: Contract creation bytecode
  initial_keys        // Array of AuthKey structs
])
```

#### Address Derivation

Addresses are derived using CREATE2 with the Account Configuration Contract (`ACCOUNT_CONFIG_ADDRESS`) as the deployer. The `initial_keys` are sorted by `keyId` before hashing to ensure address derivation is order-independent (the same set of keys always produces the same address regardless of the order specified):

```
sorted_keys = sort(initial_keys, by: keyId)
effective_salt = keccak256(abi.encode(user_salt, keccak256(abi.encode(sorted_keys))))
address = keccak256(0xff || ACCOUNT_CONFIG_ADDRESS || effective_salt || keccak256(init_code))[12:]
```

The `initial_keys` are incorporated into the salt to prevent front-running attacks where an attacker deploys with different keys. Users can receive funds at counterfactual addresses before deployment.

#### Validation (Account Initialization)

When `account_initialization` is non-empty:

1. Parse `[user_salt, init_code, initial_keys]`
2. Sort `initial_keys` by keyId: `sorted_keys = sort(initial_keys, by: keyId)`
3. Compute `effective_salt = keccak256(abi.encode(user_salt, keccak256(abi.encode(sorted_keys))))`
4. Compute `expected = keccak256(0xff || ACCOUNT_CONFIG_ADDRESS || effective_salt || keccak256(init_code))[12:]`
5. Require `from == expected`
6. Require `code_size(from) == 0` (account not yet deployed)
7. Validate `sender_auth` against one of `initial_keys` (keyId extracted from signature must match an entry's computed keyId)

#### Execution (Account Initialization)

1. Register `initial_keys` in Account Config storage for `from`: for each key, compute `keyId`, write auth_type and public_key to the key struct slots
2. Apply `key_changes` (if non-empty) — see [Cross-Chain Key Changes](#cross-chain-key-changes)
3. Deploy `init_code` at `from` using CREATE2 semantics with `effective_salt`
4. Proceed with calldata delivery

Key registration and key changes are applied before code deployment so that the constructor can read its own key configuration from the Account Config contract if needed.

#### Default Account (Chain Operator Option)

For EOA accounts, chain operators may configure a **default account**—a wallet implementation automatically used for addresses without deployed code. This enables EOAs to submit AA transactions and use AA features (batching, gas sponsorship) without explicitly deploying code via [EIP-7702](./eip-7702.md).

**Behavior**:

- EOA submits AA transaction with valid signature
- During execution, if `from` has no code, use the configured default account bytecode
- The default account interprets `calldata` (e.g., as batched calls)
- Code injection occurs at transaction time; no permanent deployment required

**Configuration**: Chain operators specify the default account bytecode hash. This is an optional feature—chains may require explicit 7702 delegation instead.

### Cross-Chain Key Changes

The `key_changes` field enables cross-chain portable key management. Key change operations include a `chain_id` field where `0` means valid on any chain, allowing them to be replayed across chains to synchronize key state.

#### Key Change Format

```
key_changes = [
  rlp([
    chain_id,           // uint64: 0 = valid on any chain
    sequence,           // uint64: monotonic ordering
    operations,         // Array of key operations
    authorizer_auth     // Signature from a key valid at this sequence
  ]),
  ...  // max MAX_KEY_CHANGES entries per transaction
]

operation = rlp([
  op_type,              // 0x01 = authorizeKey, 0x02 = revokeKey
  auth_type,            // uint8: auth type
  public_key            // bytes: public key material
])
```

Each entry represents a set of key operations authorized at a specific sequence number. The `authorizer_auth` must be valid against the account's key configuration *at the point after all previous entries in the list have been applied*.

#### Key Change Signature Payload

Key change signatures use domain separation via `KEY_CHANGE_TYPE`. The `chain_id` field controls replay scope: `0` means the key change is valid on any chain, otherwise it is only valid on the specified chain.

```
keccak256(KEY_CHANGE_TYPE || rlp([
  from,
  chain_id,
  sequence,
  operations
]))
```

The `authorizer_auth` follows the same [Signature Format](#signature-format) as `sender_auth` (EOA or configured key), validated against the account's key state at that point in the sequence.

#### Key Change Paths

Keys can be modified through three paths:

| | Portable: `key_changes` (tx field) | Portable: `applyKeyChange()` (EVM) | Local: `authorizeKey()` / `revokeKey()` (EVM) |
|--|---|---|---|
| Authorization | Signed operation (any auth type) | Signed operation (any auth type) | `msg.sender` during execution |
| Portability | Cross-chain (chain_id 0) or chain-specific | Cross-chain (chain_id 0) or chain-specific | Chain-local only |
| Sequence | Increments `key_change_sequence` | Increments `key_change_sequence` | Does NOT affect `key_change_sequence` |
| When processed | Before code deployment (8130 only) | During EVM execution (any chain) | During EVM execution |

**Portable key changes** (`key_changes` tx field or `applyKeyChange()`) use the same signed operations and the same `key_change_sequence` counter. The wallet signs a key change once; if `chain_id` is `0`, it can be submitted via either path on any chain. `applyKeyChange()` validates the authorizer signature against the account's key state, applies the operations, and increments the sequence — identical behavior to protocol-level `key_changes` processing.

**Local key changes** (`authorizeKey()` / `revokeKey()`) require `msg.sender` authorization and do **not** increment the `key_change_sequence`. These are chain-local customizations (e.g., session keys, chain-specific authorizations). When portable key changes are replayed on a new chain, they write to specific keyIds, potentially overwriting local changes at those same keyIds.

### Execution

#### Calldata Delivery

The `calldata` is delivered to `from` via self-call:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `to` | `from` |
| `tx.origin` | `from` |
| `msg.sender` | `from` |
| `msg.value` | 0 |
| `data` | `calldata` |

For EOAs without code, the call succeeds with no effect. For smart accounts, execution begins at the contract's entry point.

#### Validation vs Execution

This proposal constrains **validation** to enshrined auth types but does not constrain **execution**. Once a transaction passes validation, the account's code can implement any logic: multisig, timelocks, spending limits, session keys, or arbitrary business rules. The `calldata` is always delivered to `from` as a self-call, ensuring wallet code controls interpretation.

#### Transaction Context

During execution, accounts can query the system contract for:

- **Payer**: `getCurrentPayer()` returns the gas payer address
- **Signer**: `getCurrentSigner()` returns `(keyId, authType, publicKey)` used for authorization

### Portability

Both system contracts are standard Solidity contracts deployed at designated addresses on any EVM chain. On non-8130 chains they operate as normal contracts (ERC-4337 compatible); on 8130 chains the protocol additionally reads their storage directly for validation. See [Why a System Contract?](#why-a-system-contract) for the design rationale.

### Validation Flow

#### Mempool Acceptance

1. Verify `sender_auth` size does not exceed `MAX_SIGNATURE_SIZE` (2KB)
2. Verify `key_changes` length does not exceed `MAX_KEY_CHANGES`
3. Resolve sender address:
   - If `from` is non-empty: use provided address
   - If `from` is empty: recover address from `sender_auth` via ecrecover (EOA signature required)
4. Determine the effective key state for `sender_auth` validation:
   a. If `account_initialization` is non-empty:
      - Parse `[user_salt, init_code, initial_keys]`
      - Verify address derivation matches `from` (see [Account Initialization](#account-initialization))
      - Verify `code_size(from) == 0`
      - Start with `initial_keys` as the key state
   b. Else: read current key state from Account Config storage
5. If `key_changes` is non-empty:
   - Simulate applying `key_changes` to the key state (validate authorizer signatures, apply operations in sequence, skip already-applied entries)
6. Validate `sender_auth` against the **resulting** key state:
   - EOA signature (`from` empty): ecrecover → address, check authorization or use as `from`
   - Configured key (`from` set): parse `auth_type`, derive or parse `keyId`. Verify authorization and type match.
7. Resolve payer from `payer_auth` and validate against sender's signed marker:
   - If sender signed `0x80` (self-pay): `payer_auth` MUST be empty. Payer is `from`.
   - If sender signed `0x00` (sponsored): `payer_auth` MUST be 65 bytes. Recover payer via ecrecover (using `AA_PAYER_TYPE` for domain separation).
8. Verify `fee_token` is empty (reject if non-empty until future EIPs define valid formats)
9. Verify nonce (read from Nonce Manager), payer ETH balance, expiry
10. Mempool threshold: payer's pending sponsored transaction count must be below node-configured limits

#### Block Execution

1. ETH gas deduction from payer
2. Increment nonce in Nonce Manager storage
3. Process authorization_list ([EIP-7702](./eip-7702.md))
4. Register `initial_keys` in Account Config storage (if `account_initialization` non-empty)
5. Apply `key_changes` to Account Config storage (if non-empty)
6. Deploy `init_code` at `from` (if `account_initialization` non-empty)
7. Deliver calldata to `from` via self-call

### RPC Extensions

**`eth_getTransactionCount`**: Extended with optional `nonceKey` parameter (uint192) to query 2D nonce channels. Reads from the Nonce Manager contract at `NONCE_MANAGER_ADDRESS`.

**`eth_getTransactionReceipt`**: Should include `payer` field.

## Rationale

### Why a System Contract?

The Account Configuration Contract is a standard Solidity contract—not a precompile—deployed at a designated address. A true precompile (native node code with no EVM bytecode) would offer negligible gas savings here because the contract's operations are dominated by storage costs (SLOAD/SSTORE).

Using a system contract instead of a precompile provides key advantages:

1. **Portability**: The identical Solidity contract deploys on any EVM chain. On non-8130 chains it works as a standard contract (compatible with ERC-4337 as an unstaked factory). On 8130 chains, the protocol additionally reads its storage directly for validation.
2. **Protocol-level validation**: On 8130 chains, the protocol reads the contract's well-defined storage slots directly to validate AA transaction signatures—no EVM execution required during validation. The protocol can keep these storage slots warm for efficient access.
3. **Onchain interface**: Smart contracts call the system contract during execution to:
   - Modify keys (`authorizeKey()`, `revokeKey()`, `applyKeyChange()`)
   - Query transaction context (`getCurrentSigner()`, `getCurrentPayer()`)
   - Validate signatures for 4337 compatibility (`validateSignature()`)

Having the system contract accessible onchain means that accounts can build any additional recovery logic into their code.

### Why a Separate Nonce Contract?

Nonce state is isolated in its own system contract (`NONCE_MANAGER_ADDRESS`) rather than stored alongside key configurations in the Account Configuration Contract. This separation is motivated by their fundamentally different access patterns:

| Property | Key Config | Nonces |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Write frequency | Rare (key rotation) | Every AA transaction |
| Read frequency | Every validation | Every validation |
| Growth | Rare (gas-bounded) | Unbounded (nonce channels) |

**Storage trie performance**: Both contracts accumulate state for every AA account on the chain. Nonces are the hottest write data—every AA transaction mutates a nonce slot. Mixing high-frequency nonce writes with rarely-updated key data in the same storage trie degrades performance at scale: trie depth grows faster, nonce updates re-hash through branches containing key data, and node caching strategies cannot be optimized independently for each access pattern. Separate storage tries allow nodes to optimize caching and pruning strategies for each workload independently.

**Modularity**: The Nonce Manager is a minimal contract with a read-only EVM interface (`getNonce()`). Nonce increments are protocol-only operations. This clean separation means nonce logic can evolve independently, and the Nonce Manager could potentially be reused by other transaction types or systems.

### Why CREATE2 for Account Initialization?

Account initialization uses CREATE2 with `ACCOUNT_CONFIG_ADDRESS` as the deployer address for cross-chain portability:

1. **Deterministic addresses**: Same `user_salt + init_code + initial_keys` produces the same address on any chain
2. **Pre-deployment funding**: Users can receive funds at counterfactual addresses before deployment
3. **Portability**: The same Solidity contract at `ACCOUNT_CONFIG_ADDRESS` implements identical address derivation on all chains, enabling the same address whether using native 8130 or ERC-4337
4. **Front-running prevention**: Including `initial_keys` in the salt prevents attackers from deploying with different keys to steal counterfactual funds

The protocol executes CREATE2 semantics directly without having to call into potentially arbitrary code factories.

### Why Fee Token Field?

The `fee_token` field enables future token-based gas payment without defining a new transaction type:

1. **Token payments**: A future EIP defines the packed format (`token_address || max_amount`) for gas abstraction with ERC-20 tokens.
2. **Signature binding**: The sender signs over `fee_token`, ensuring they explicitly authorize any token payment terms.

This approach provides upgrade flexibility while keeping the initial specification minimal and focused on ETH-based gas payment.

### Smart Wallet Migration Path

Existing ERC-4337 smart accounts migrate to native AA without redeployment:

1. **Register keys**: Call `authorizeKey()` on the system contract to authorize existing signing keys (K1, R1, WebAuthn, etc.)
2. **Upgrade wallet logic**: Update contract to use the system contract as source of truth:
   - Call `isAuthorized()` / `validateSignature()` for signature verification
   - Call `getCurrentSigner()` during execution to identify which key authorized the transaction
3. **Backwards compatible**: Wallet can still accept ERC-4337 UserOps via EntryPoint alongside native AA transactions

### Why Auth Type Byte Encoding?

The `from` field's presence distinguishes EOA from configured key signatures, avoiding reliance on a magic prefix byte that could collide with valid ECDSA `r` values. Configured key signatures use `auth_type || keyId || signature_data`, with K1 optionally omitting keyId since ecrecover derives it.

All non-K1 types verify against stored public keys. The keyId-based format minimizes calldata — particularly important for L2s where data availability costs dominate — while the 1-byte auth type supports up to 255 types for future additions (quantum-safe algorithms, ZK-proof auth) without protocol changes.

### Future Auth Types

The auth type system is designed to be extensible. Potential additions include ZK-proof-based auth types, where a succinct proof of off-chain validation replaces a traditional signature. Because proof verification is a fixed algorithm with bounded cost, this fits the protocol's validation model without reintroducing arbitrary EVM execution during transaction validation. This can be used for fully self soverign recovery without intermediarys / relayers.

## Backwards Compatibility

No breaking changes. Existing EOAs and smart contracts function unchanged. Adoption is opt-in:

- EOAs continue sending standard transactions
- ERC-4337 infrastructure continues operating
- Accounts gain AA capabilities by configuring keys or using the new transaction type, note that code needs to be deployed to do anything useful as calldata is sent to the address and must be interpreted. Chains can opt in for default accounts to not require deployment via 7702 for EOA keys.

## Reference Implementation

### IAccountConfig

```solidity
interface IAccountConfig {
    struct AuthKey {
        uint8 authType;
        bytes publicKey;
    }
    
    event KeyAuthorized(address indexed account, bytes20 indexed keyId, uint8 authType, bytes publicKey);
    event KeyRevoked(address indexed account, bytes20 indexed keyId);
    event AccountCreated(address indexed account, bytes32 userSalt, bytes32 codeHash);
    event KeyChangeApplied(address indexed account, uint64 sequence);
    
    // Account creation (factory interface for portability)
    function createAccount(bytes32 userSalt, bytes calldata initCode, AuthKey[] calldata initialKeys) external returns (address);
    function getAddress(bytes32 userSalt, bytes calldata initCode, AuthKey[] calldata initialKeys) external view returns (address);
    
    // Key management (local, requires msg.sender)
    function authorizeKey(uint8 authType, bytes calldata publicKey) external returns (bytes20 keyId);
    function revokeKey(bytes20 keyId) external;
    function isAuthorized(address account, bytes20 keyId) external view returns (bool);
    function getKeyData(address account, bytes20 keyId) external view returns (uint8 authType, bytes memory publicKey);
    function validateSignature(address account, bytes20 keyId, bytes32 messageHash, bytes calldata signature) external view returns (bool);
    
    // Portable key changes (cross-chain replayable, increments key_change_sequence)
    struct KeyOperation {
        uint8 opType;       // 0x01 = authorizeKey, 0x02 = revokeKey
        uint8 authType;
        bytes publicKey;
    }
    function applyKeyChange(address account, uint64 chainId, uint64 sequence, KeyOperation[] calldata operations, bytes calldata authorizerAuth) external;
    function getKeyChangeSequence(address account) external view returns (uint64);
    
    // Transaction context (only valid during AA transaction execution)
    function getCurrentPayer() external view returns (address);
    function getCurrentSigner() external view returns (bytes20 keyId, uint8 authType, bytes memory publicKey);
}
```

### INonceManager

```solidity
interface INonceManager {
    // Read nonce for a given account and nonce channel
    function getNonce(address account, uint192 nonceKey) external view returns (uint64);
}
```

The Nonce Manager contract is deployed at `NONCE_MANAGER_ADDRESS`.

## Security Considerations

**Enshrined Validation**: Signature verification uses well-established algorithms before any EVM execution. Failed validation rejects transactions before mempool entry.

**Replay Protection**: Transactions include `chain_id`, 2D nonce, and `expiry`.

**Key Management**: Only `msg.sender` can modify account configuration via local EVM calls. Portable key changes require signature authorization from a key valid at that sequence point. EOA key always retains authorization for recovery (if created with an EOA via 7702). No artificial key limit is enforced—gas costs for SSTORE naturally bound key creation. `MAX_KEY_CHANGES` bounds per-transaction processing cost, and `KEY_CHANGE_TYPE` domain separation prevents authorizer signatures from being reused as transaction signatures.

**Delegation**: `DELEGATE` auth type limited to 1 hop to prevent loops.

**Fee Token Safety**: Nodes MUST reject transactions with non-empty `fee_token` until future EIPs define valid formats.

**Payer Security**: Sponsors must sign each transaction they pay for. Separate type bytes (`AA_TX_TYPE` vs `AA_PAYER_TYPE`) provide domain separation, preventing signature reuse between sender and payer roles. The sender signs a marker byte (`0x80` for self-pay, `0x00` for sponsored) in the `payer_auth` hash position, committing to sponsorship intent. Self-pay transactions cannot have a payer attached after signing; sponsored transactions cannot land without a valid payer.

**Signature Size Limits**: Signatures exceeding `MAX_SIGNATURE_SIZE` (2KB) MUST be rejected. This prevents DoS attacks via oversized WebAuthn signatures. The 2KB limit accommodates typical WebAuthn signatures with ample headroom. Future key types with larger signatures (e.g., post-quantum schemes) may require per-type size limits.

**Account Initialization Security**: The `initial_keys` are incorporated into the CREATE2 salt (see [Address Derivation](#address-derivation)), preventing front-running attacks where an attacker deploys with different keys to steal funds at a counterfactual address.
