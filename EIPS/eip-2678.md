## Simple Summary

A data format describing a smart contract software package.


## Abstract

This EIP defines a data format for *package manifest* documents,
representing a package of one or more smart contracts, optionally
including source code and any/all deployed instances across multiple
networks. Package manifests are minified JSON objects, to be distributed
via content addressable storage networks, such as IPFS. Packages
are then published to on-chain EthPM registries, defined in
[EIP-1319](./eip-1319.md), from where they can be freely accessed.

This document presents a natural language description of a formal
specification for version **3** of this format.


## Motivation

This standard aims to encourage the Ethereum development ecosystem
towards software best practices around code reuse. By defining an open,
community-driven package data format standard, this effort seeks to
provide support for package management tools development by offering a
general-purpose solution that has been designed with observed common
practices in mind.

-   Updates the schema for a *package manifest* to be compatible with
	the [metadata](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metadata.html) output for compilers.
-   Updates the `"sources"` object definition to support a wider range of source file types and serve as [JSON input](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description) for a compiler.
-   Moves compiler definitions to a top-level `"compilers"` array in order to:
	-   Simplify the links between a compiler version, sources, and the
		compiled assets.
	-   Simplify packages that use multiple compiler versions.
-   Updates key formatting from `snake_case` to `camelCase` to be
	more consistent with [JSON convention](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml?showone=Property_Name_Format#Property_Name_Format).

### Guiding Principles

This specification makes the following assumptions about the document
lifecycle.

1.  Package manifests are intended to be generated programmatically by
    package management software as part of the release process.

2.  Package manifests will be consumed by package managers during tasks
    like installing package dependencies or building and deploying new
    releases.

3.  Package manifests will typically **not** be stored alongside the
    source, but rather by package registries *or* referenced by package
    registries and stored in something akin to IPFS.

4.  Package manifests can be used to verify public deployments of source 
	contracts.

### Use Cases

The following use cases were considered during the creation of this
specification.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| owned | A package which contains contracts which are not meant to be used by themselves but rather as base contracts to provide functionality to other contracts through inheritance. |
| transferable | A package which has a single dependency. |
| standard-token | A package which contains a reusable contract. |
| safe-math-lib | A package which contains deployed instance of one of the package contracts. |
| piper-coin | A package which contains a deployed instance of a reusable contract from a dependency. |
| escrow | A package which contains a deployed instance of a local contract which is linked against a deployed instance of a local library. |
| wallet | A package with a deployed instance of a local contract which is linked against a deployed instance of a library from a dependency. |
| wallet-with-send | A package with a deployed instance which links against a deep dependency. |
| simple-auction | Compiler `"metadata"` field output. |

## Package Specification

### Conventions

#### RFC2119

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

-   <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>


#### Prefixed vs Unprefixed

A [prefixed](#prefixed) hexadecimal value begins with `0x`.
[Unprefixed](#unprefixed) values have no prefix. Unless otherwise
specified, all hexadecimal values **should** be represented with the
`0x` prefix.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Prefixed | `0xdeadbeef` |
| Unprefixed | `deadbeef` |

### Document Format

The canonical format is a single JSON object. Packages **must** conform
to the following serialization rules.

-   The document **must** be tightly packed, meaning no linebreaks or
    extra whitespace.

-   The keys in all objects **must** be sorted alphabetically.

-   Duplicate keys in the same object are invalid.

-   The document **must** use
    [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
    encoding.

-   The document **must** not have a trailing newline.

-   To ensure backwards compatibility, `manifest_version` is a forbidden
    top-level key.


### Document Specification

The following fields are defined for the package. Custom fields **may**
be included. Custom fields **should** be prefixed with `x-` to prevent
name collisions with future versions of the specification.

    blockchain://<genesis_hash>/block/<latest confirmed block hash>

The `<genesis hash>` represents the blockhash of the first block on the
chain, and `<latest confirmed block hash>` represents the hash of the
latest block that’s been reliably confirmed (package managers should be
free to choose their desired level of confirmations).

### Glossary

The terms in this glossary have been updated to reflect the changes made
in V3.

#### ABI  
The JSON representation of the application binary interface. See the
official
[specification](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html)
for more information.

#### Address  
A public identifier for an account on a particular chain

#### Bytecode  
The set of EVM instructions as produced by a compiler. Unless otherwise
specified this should be assumed to be hexadecimal encoded, representing
a whole number of bytes, and [prefixed](#prefixed) with `0x`.

Bytecode can either be linked or unlinked. (see
[Linking](#linking))

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Unlinked Bytecode | The hexadecimal representation of a contract’s EVM instructions that contains sections of code that requires [linking](#linking) for the contract to be functional.<br>The sections of code which are unlinked **must** be filled in with zero bytes.<br>**Example**: `0x606060405260e06000730000000000000000000000000000000000000000634d536f` |
| Linked Bytecode | The hexadecimal representation of a contract’s EVM instructions which has had all [Link References](#link-reference) replaced with the desired [Link Values](#link-value). **Example**: `0x606060405260e06000736fe36000604051602001526040518160e060020a634d536f` |

#### Chain Definition  
This definition originates from [BIP122
URI](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0122.mediawiki).

A URI in the format `blockchain://<chain_id>/block/<block_hash>`

-   `chain_id` is the unprefixed hexadecimal representation of the
    genesis hash for the chain.

-   `block_hash` is the unprefixed hexadecimal representation of the
    hash of a block on the chain.

A chain is considered to match a chain definition if the the genesis
block hash matches the `chain_id` and the block defined by `block_hash`
can be found on that chain. It is possible for multiple chains to match
a single URI, in which case all chains are considered valid matches

#### Content Addressable URI  
Any URI which contains a cryptographic hash which can be used to verify
the integrity of the content found at the URI.

The URI format is defined in RFC3986

It is **recommended** that tools support IPFS and Swarm.

#### Contract Alias  
This is a name used to reference a specific [Contract
Type](#contract-type). Contract aliases **must** be unique within a
single [Package](#package).

The contract alias **must** use *one of* the following naming schemes:

-   `<contract-name>`

-   `<contract-name><identifier>`

The `<contract-name>` portion **must** be the same as the [Contract
Name](#contract-name) for this contract type.

The `<identifier>` portion **must** match the regular expression
`^[-a-zA-Z0-9]{1,256}$`.

#### Contract Instance  
A contract instance a specific deployed version of a [Contract
Type](#contract-type).

All contract instances have an [Address](#address) on some specific
chain.

#### Contract Instance Name  
A name which refers to a specific [Contract
Instance](#contract-instance) on a specific chain from the
deployments of a single [Package](#package). This name **must** be
unique across all other contract instances for the given chain. The name
must conform to the regular expression
`^[a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z0-9_$]{0,255}$`

In cases where there is a single deployed instance of a given [Contract
Type](#contract-type), package managers **should** use the
[Contract Alias](#contract-alias) for that contract type for this
name.

In cases where there are multiple deployed instances of a given contract
type, package managers **should** use a name which provides some added
semantic information as to help differentiate the two deployed instances
in a meaningful way.

#### Contract Name  
The name found in the source code that defines a specific [Contract
Type](#contract-type). These names **must** conform to the regular
expression `^[a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z0-9_$]{0,255}$`.

There can be multiple contracts with the same contract name in a
projects source files.

#### Contract Type  
Refers to a specific contract in the package source. This term can be
used to refer to an abstract contract, a normal contract, or a library.
Two contracts are of the same contract type if they have the same
bytecode.

Example:

    contract Wallet {
        ...
    }

A deployed instance of the `Wallet` contract would be of of type
`Wallet`.

#### Identifier  
Refers generally to a named entity in the [Package](#package).

A string matching the regular expression
`^[a-zA-Z][-_a-zA-Z0-9]{0,255}$`

#### Link Reference  
A location within a contract’s bytecode which needs to be linked. A link
reference has the following properties.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `offset` | Defines the location within the bytecode where the link reference begins. |
| `length` | Defines the length of the reference. |
| `name` | (optional) A string to identify the reference. |

#### Link Value  
A link value is the value which can be inserted in place of a [Link
Reference](#link-reference)

#### Linking  
The act of replacing [Link References](#link-reference) with [Link
Values](#link-value) within some [Bytecode](#bytecode).

#### Package  
Distribution of an application’s source or compiled bytecode along with
metadata related to authorship, license, versioning, et al.

For brevity, the term **Package** is often used metonymously to mean
[Package Manifest](#package-manifest).

#### Package Manifest  
A machine-readable description of a package.

#### Prefixed  
[Bytecode](#bytecode) string with leading `0x`.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Example | `0xdeadbeef` |

#### Unprefixed  
Not [Prefixed](#prefixed).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Example | `deadbeef` |

## Rationale

### Minification

EthPM packages are distributed as alphabetically-ordered & minified JSON to ensure consistency.
Since packages are published on content-addressable filesystems (eg. IPFS), this restriction
guarantees that any given set of contract assets will always resolve to the same content-addressed URI.

### Package Names

Package names are restricted to lower-case characters, numbers, and `-` to improve the readability
of the package name, in turn improving the security properties for a package. A user is more likely
to accurately identify their target package with this restricted set of characters, and not confuse
a malicious package that disguises itself as a trusted package with similar but different 
characters (e.g. `O` and `0`).

### BIP122

The BIP-122 standard has been used since EthPM v1 since it is an industry standard URI scheme for
identifying different blockchains and distinguishing between forks.

### Compilers

Compilers are now defined in a top-level array, simplifying the task for tooling to identify the compiler types
needed to interact with or validate the contract assets. This also removes unnecessarily duplicated
information, should multiple `contractTypes` share the same compiler type.

## Backwards Compatibility

To improve understanding and readability of the EthPM spec, the
`manifest_version` field was updated to `manifest` in v3. To ensure 
backwards compatibility, v3 packages **must** define a top-level
`"manifest"` with a value of `"ethpm/3"`. Additionally,
`"manifest_version"` is a forbidden top-level key in v3 packages.


## Security Considerations

Using EthPM packages implicitly requires importing &/or executing code written by others. The EthPM spec
guarantees that when using a properly constructed and released EthPM package, the user will have the exact same
code that was included in the package by the package author. However, it is impossible to guarantee that this code
is safe to interact with. Therefore, it is critical that end users only interact with EthPM packages authored and
released by individuals or organizations that they trust to include non-malicious code.
