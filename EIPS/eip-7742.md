## Abstract

Update blob maximum, target, and blob gas fee computation from [EIP-4844](./eip-4844.md).

The execution layer no longer verifies the blob maximum and receives the target dynamically from the consensus layer.

## Motivation

Following EIP-4844, the execution layer (EL) maintains a hard-coded blob target value and blob maximum value. Given the relationship
of the EL and the consensus layer (CL) node software, the verification of the blob maximum is redundant so it can be removed
entirely without any change in security. The blob maximum is still provided during block construction via the Engine API.
This EIP also changes how the EL sources the current blob target value for two reasons:

1) Gain more flexibility over the value, rather than the static `TARGET == MAX // 2` relation in EIP-4844.

2) Uncouple development and deployment of the CL and EL layers in the event it is desirable to change the blob target value.

### Background

The data facility introduced via EIP-4844 adds blobs to Ethereum blocks, which are simply fixed sets of data that can be
included in the canonical chain but have no execution semantics (cf. `calldata` in an Ethereum transaction).

The protocol specifies a maximum allowed blobs per block to prevent DoS vectors via the abuse of this data facility.
The protocol also maintains an [EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md)-like "target" value for an intended running average amount of blob throughput per
unit time. Blob usage is compared against this target to influence a "blob base fee" to administer allocation of this
resource to users of the Ethereum protocol.

Both of these values are currently hard-coded in the EL after EIP-4844 and the blob maximum is separately hard-coded in
the CL following EIP-4844. This EIP proposes a set of changes to uncouple these values across the CL and EL to make development
and deployment of changes to the blobs per block easier.

#### Maximum blobs per block

The blob maximum is verified in the CL node and the EL inherits this verification during the consistency check of the versioned hashes corresponding to each blob as specified by the Engine API. Because of this, the strict check specified by EIP-4844 is unnecessary.

For optimistically synced blocks from peer nodes, EL may further assume that the entire ancestor EL peer synced chain blocks correctly obeys this condition by the canonicality and correctness of the block they backfilling from as instructed by the CL.

Hence we entirely deprecated the `MAX_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK` checks from [EIP-4844](./eip-4844.md).

#### Target blobs per block

The target is currently specified as a fixed value in relation to the blobs per block. The Ethereum community intends to increase the blob parameters as part of its scaling strategy and the ability to have a more flexible target value in relation to the blob max is desirable to reduce rigidity in this protocol parameter.

Even if the EL keeps a fixed target value based on the max, removing the max implies the EL would not know what the target value should be. To address this lack of information, this EIP proposes the CL sends the current target value to the EL with each provided payload over the Engine API. The EL block header will also need to be extended with this `target_blobs_per_block` value to preserve the security of optimistic sync.

#### Updated Fee calculations

With the changing target, we also need to scale the `BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION` from [EIP-4844](./eip-4844.md) accordingly to bound the price jumps by +-12.5%. But this introduces some irregularity on the fork block because excess blob gas is effectively scaled down by this changed factor in the fee calculations.

However we consider the target change events to be few and far between and hence not a cause of concern. The likely effect of this factor update will be to bring down the base fee on the fork block and hence would not negatively impact the transactions in txpool.

## Specification

### Block processing

Upon activation of this EIP, execution clients **MUST** extend the header schema with an
additional 64-bit field: the `target_blobs_per_block`. This values is set to the one provided by the CL during block production.

Any reference to `TARGET_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK` from [EIP-4844](./eip-4844.md) (for e.g. for `excess_blob_gas` calculations) can be derived by taking the `target_blobs_per_block` from the EL block header and multiplying by `GAS_PER_BLOB`.

Validity of these values is guaranteed from the consensus layer, much like how withdrawals are handled. Hence when verifying a block, execution clients **MUST** ensure the target blobs per block in the block header matches the one provided by the consensus client.

Furthermore `get_base_fee_per_blob_gas` as specified by [EIP-4844](./eip-4844.md) is as modified below:

| Constant | Value |
| - | - |
| `BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION_PER_TARGET_BLOB` | `1112825` |


```python
def calc_excess_blob_gas(parent: Header) -> int:
  parent_target_blob_gas = parent.target_blobs_per_block * GAS_PER_BLOB
  if parent.excess_blob_gas + parent.blob_gas_used < parent_target_blob_gas:
    return 0
  else:
    return parent.excess_blob_gas + parent.blob_gas_used - parent_target_blob_gas

def get_base_fee_per_blob_gas(header: Header) -> int:
  update_fraction = BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION_PER_TARGET_BLOB * header.target_blobs_per_block
  return fake_exponential(
    MIN_BASE_FEE_PER_BLOB_GAS,
    header.excess_blob_gas,
    update_fraction
    )
```

Rest of the [EIP-4844](./eip-4844.md) specification is not changed

### Block construction

To kickstart block construction, CL will now provide EL a target and a maximum blobs per block. These values should be used to ensure the correct number of blobs are included in any constructed payload, and to ensure that the blob base fee accounting is correctly done as specified above.

For a genesis block with no existing parent, the value should be set according to the agreed specification for the target blobs per block given by that genesis block's protocol rule set. For the purposes of this EIP, the `target_blobs_per_block` at genesis is set equivalent to [EIP-4844](./eip-4844.md)'s `TARGET_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK`.

## Rationale

### Why not have the CL also compute the blob base fee and remove any notion of blobs per block from EL processing?

Hoisting the full computation into the CL is possible, but it does violate the separation of concerns between these two layers of the protocol stack.
The CL maintains a maximum value to address e.g. DoS risks, and the EL maintains knowledge of the target value to address fee accounting.
Putting the target computation in the CL violates the respective responsibilities of each layer.
