## Abstract

Reduce the intrinsic cost `TX_BASE_COST` from `21,000` to `8,000`.

If a non-create transation has `value > 0` and targets a **non-existent** account add `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT` = `25,000` to align with `CALL` account creation and price in state growth.

This additional `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT` cost is not applied in the case of a `CREATE` transaction as it is already applied in its cost structure.

Calldata and access‑list metering are unchanged.

## Motivation

The current `21,000` intrinsic gas is a legacy constant. It no longer matches the work all transactions must perform under warm/cold accounting. When decomposed into signature recovery, warming `sender` and `to`, and two warm writes for nonce and balance, the common path totals `8,000` gas.

Top‑level value transfers that create new accounts do not pay an explicit new‑account surcharge today, while `CALL` does. This underprices state growth. Charging `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT = 25,000` on value transfers that create an account aligns entry points and internalizes state growth.

A high fixed base penalizes small ETH payments and encourages batching to dodge the base rather than for real efficiency. Lowering the base removes that distortion while leaving calldata and storage prices unchanged.

The result is cheaper ETH transfers without subsidies: state growth costs the same whether reached by `CALL` or by a top‑level transfer. Access‑list and 1559 mechanics are unchanged.

We intentionally do **not** charge per‑byte gas for the transaction envelope (`nonce`, `gas*`, `to`, `value`, `v`,`r`,`s`). Calldata pricing applies only to `tx.data`. A plain ETH payment has empty tx.data, so it pays zero calldata gas. Lowering `TX_BASE_COST` to the universal work path makes ETH payments cheaper without subsidizing arbitrary calldata.

## Specification

After `FORK_BLOCK`, set `TX_BASE_COST` = 8,000; apply `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT` as specified.

If the transaction has `value > 0` and is sending to a non-existent account (as per [EIP-161](./eip-161.md)) and not a precompile; so results in account creation, then the `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT` cost is additionally applied as per `CALL`; resulting in an increase from `21000` to `33000` a +12,000 increase over current. This normalises account creation cost via evm CALL or TX send and addressing state growth concerns.

In `transactions.py`

```diff
-TX_BASE_COST = Uint(21000)
+TX_BASE_COST = Uint(8000)
"""
Base cost of a transaction in gas units. This is the minimum amount of gas required to execute a transaction.
"""
```

EIP‑1559/2930/7702 transactions that currently reference the `21,000` base inherit this new constant of `8,000`.

### Derivation (non‑normative)

Sender is recovered from signature, so is ecrecover cost. Sender and To should match Access List pricing.

```
ECRECOVER_COST = 3,000
ACCESS_LIST_ADDRESS_COST = 2,400
WARM_ACCOUNT_WRITE_COST = 100
GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT = 25,000
```

```
TX_BASE_COST =
    ECRECOVER_COST
    + 2 * ACCESS_LIST_ADDRESS_COST
    + 2 * WARM_ACCOUNT_WRITE_COST
    = 8,000
```

## Rationale

Price only what every transaction always does: ECDSA recovery, warming `sender` and `to`, and two warm writes. That sums to `8,000` gas. Anything not universal should be metered separately.

Calldata remains metered per byte. No calldata allowance is folded into the base. This reinforces ETH as money and payments: a plain ETH transfer carries no calldata, executes no bytecode, and touches no contract storage slots. It only updates warm account nonce and balance, so it receives the discount.

When a value transfer creates a previously empty account, charge `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT = 25,000`, identical to `CALL` account‑creation pricing. `CREATE` is unchanged because its cost already includes account creation. Access‑list pricing is unchanged.

This removes cross‑subsidies, aligns charges with resources, and keeps costs equal across paths that perform the same state growth.

Do not fold any calldata allowance into the base. The envelope RLP (`nonce`, `gas*`, `to`, `value`, `v`,`r`,`s`) is not charged as calldata and remains unmetered per byte. Only `tx.data` bytes are metered at the existing calldata schedule, and access lists keep their per‑entry costs. A vanilla ETH transfer executes no bytecode and touches no contract storage slots; it performs signature recovery, warms sender and to, and does two warm writes (nonce, balance). It therefore receives the base discount and zero calldata gas.

Bundling multiple transfers into a single contract call avoids repeated `TX_BASE_COST`, but those transfers then execute serially inside one EVM context. That blocks parallel execution. With a lower per-tx base cost, users have less incentive to bundle, so more transfers remain independent transactions. Independent transactions can be scheduled across threads, which improves parallelism at the client and execution-layer level.

Thus, reducing `TX_BASE_COST` not only corrects mispricing but also increases the share of transactions that are naturally parallelizable.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is backward compatible.

Wallet default gas limits and simulations must update.

### Example tx gas cost changes

* Simple ETH transfer to an existing EOA: intrinsic drops from `21,000` to `8,000`. (-62%)
* ETH transfer that creates a new EOA: intrinsic becomes `8,000 + 25,000` = `33,000`. (+57%)
* Simple ERC-20 Token transfer (USDT) drops from `63,200` to `50,200` (-20%)

## Test Cases

While the benefits of reducing transactions' intrinsic cost are apparent, such a change should be applied if it impose no negative externalities, or if such effects are negligible.

Tests should be created with blocks of just ETH transfers and tested on Perfnet across all EL clients to ensure the pricing is correct.

## Security Considerations

As this increases the max tx per block by 162.5% that carries risk.

However this pricing should be the same as performing the component changes inside the a transaction; and it factors in the additional costs from state growth which were not originally in the original transaction base price.

Current gaslimit testing mostly uses a block with a single transaction; so this should should not cause unexpected load compared to what already being tested.
