## Abstract
Reduce the intrinsic cost of a transaction from `21,000` to `7,000` gas.

## Motivation
The current `21,000` gas intrinsic cost of a transaction makes sending ETH very costly, often times prohibitively costly for small amounts (tens of USD).
While broad changes to the gas price and first price auction are being considerted in other EIPs (like EIP-1559),
substantialy reducing the cost of sending ETH and enabling higher volumes of such transactions would be a net positive if done in a safe manner,
and without imposing negative externalities, as outlined below.


## Specification
After `block.number >= FORK_BLOCK`, enforce an intrinsic gas cost of `7,000`.

## Rationale

The proliferation of calls to DeFi smart-contracts had substantially increased the cost of making transactions,
since such calls are usually both time sensitive and involve large sums of money.
While the utilization of the chain's capacity by the most valuable transactions is by design,
the high cost of sending transactionsz is limiting Ethereum's the use-cases,
create a terribel user experience,
decreases the actual value created (and captured) by ETH,
and pushes users to seek alternatives in other, less-congested chains.


Note on Layer-2: It is true that the high cost might push users to try using L2 solutions,
however forcing users to utilize L2 by allowing the UX of using L1 to deteriorate is a losing strategy (see BTC / Lightning),
and the safety of many L2 solutions hinges on the ability to use L1 if needed.
If L2 are to gain significant traction they must achieve it by providing superior properties (e.g., finality, cost, UX),
not by imposing artificial restrictions to encourage it. 


Reducing the intrinsic cost of a transaction from `21,000` to `7,000` gas will make sending transactions cheaper,
is easily achievable, and does not incur technical debt.
However, such a change should only be made after it is determined that it does not impose non-negligble externalities, specifically:

* Increases uncle-rate.

* Increases the pace at which the state-size of Ethereum grows.

* Enhance gas-manipulation technices (gas-token).


## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP is backward compatible as well as compatible with other approaches pursued in other EIPs.

## Test Cases
While the benefits of reducing transactions' intrinsic cost are appearant,
such a change should be applied if it impose no negative externalities,
or if such effects are negligible.


#### Increased Uncle Rate

Historically, periods of high transaction counts has correlated with
higher-than-average uncle blocks being mined. It must be determined that the
new intrinsic cost `7,000` will not adversely affect uncle rate.

A testnet applying this change should be deployed to test the effect of this change on uncle rate.

details TBD.


## Implementation
TBD

## Security Considerations


#### Increased State Size Growth

The growth of Ethereum's state size continues to raise concerns among members of the community.
An anlysis of the contribution of "simple" transactions to the state size of the mainnet must be done to determine that it
indeed does not have a significant effect.

details TBD.


#### Enhancing Gas-Manipulation (gas-token)

Gas Tokens do not actually increase the state-size lon-term, as they release all the data they store in order to benefit from their gas boost.
However, they do manipulate the gas price auction.
It appears that reducing the Tx cost will allow gas tokens v.2 to have aslightly lower inital investment, changing it maximum savings from x3.49 to x3.50, and doesn't make any fundemental change to its ability to save costs when bidding high gas price.
A full analysis of this is required to assert that this is indeed a non-issue.
