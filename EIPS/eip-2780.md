## Abstract

Reduce the intrinsic cost `TX_BASE_COST` from `21,000` to `4,500` and define a consistent gas accounting model based on actual state operations. This more granular approach makes a simple ETH transfer `6,000` from additional costs related to the `to` account.

If a non-create transaction has `value > 0` and targets a non-existent account, charge `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT = 25,000` to align with `CALL` account creation and price in state growth. When this surcharge applies, the recipient pays exactly one cold non-code touch; no code-load cost applies.

This EIP does not change calldata or access-list metering. It also refines related gas schedule items used in derivation and execution accounting:

- Split cold-account touches into `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_CODE = 2,600` and `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE = 500`.
- Introduce `STATE_UPDATE = 1,000` as the price of a single account-leaf write.
- Reprice value-moving calls as account-leaf writes, replacing `CALL_VALUE_COST = 9,000` with `CALL_VALUE_COST = 2 * STATE_UPDATE = 2,000`.
- Specify that a `PAY`-style value-move primitive, if present, does not warm its recipient and never loads code (charged at `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE` if not already warmed).

Capacity impact (illustrative):

- Average: about +20.8% more transactions per block at unchanged gas limit.
- Max: up to ~320% more minimal transactions (pure ETH transfers).
- Equivalent gas-limit effect: roughly +20.8% (for example, 60M -> ~72.5M), with calldata and access-list metering unchanged.

## Motivation

The legacy `21,000` base no longer matches the universal work path under warm/cold accounting. Decomposed into signature recovery, one account-leaf write for the sender (nonce + balance coalesced), and one cold non-code touch (sender), the universal path totals `4,500` gas.

State growth is underpriced for top-level value transfers that create accounts, while `CALL` pays explicit creation. Charging `25,000` when a transfer creates an account aligns entry points and internalizes state growth.

A lower base removes the distortion that over-incentivized batching solely to dodge `TX_BASE_COST`, without subsidizing calldata or storage. The refinement of value-transfer costs and cold-account pricing makes execution charges proportional to actual state work: account touches and leaf writes.

We intentionally do **not** charge per-byte gas for the transaction envelope (`nonce`, `gas*`, `to`, `value`, `v`, `r`, `s`). Calldata pricing applies only to `tx.data`. A plain ETH payment has empty `tx.data`, so it pays zero calldata gas. Lowering `TX_BASE_COST` to the universal work path makes ETH payments cheaper without subsidizing arbitrary calldata.

### Equivalent gas-limit increase

Lowering `TX_BASE_COST` from `21,000` to `4,500` removes `15,000` gas per transaction. Using recent totals of 163 Ggas/day and 1.7 M tx/day:

| Metric                       | Calculation     | Result          | Change    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------:| ---------------:| ---------:|
| Avg gas per tx               | 163Bn / 1.7M    | ≈ 95,882 gas    | -         |
| New avg gas per tx           | 95,882 − 16,500 | ≈ 79,382 gas    | -         |
| Throughput at fixed gaslimit | 95,882 / 79,382 | ≈ x1.208        | +20.08%   |
| Daily tx at same gas usage   | 1.7M × 1.208    | ≈ 2.053M tx/day | +340k/day |

Perfnet measurements show EL clients handle >300 MGas/s for pure ETH transfers. Expressed under a 4.5k base this corresponds to `300 * (4.5/21) ~ 64.3 MGas/s`, i.e. `~771 MGas` per 12 s slot. This indicates sufficient headroom and that the current base is significantly overcharged, so no extra engineering is required to improve performance to support this change.

Net effect equals raising a 45 M gas limit to ~54.4 M at unchanged calldata and access-list metering. This directly advances Scaling L1.

## Specification

After `FORK_BLOCK`, set the following parameters and rules:

### Parameters

| Name                       |  Value | Description                                                             |
| -------------------------- | -----: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TX_BASE_COST`             |  4,500 | Base cost of any transaction                                            |
| `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT`          | 25,000 | Surcharge when a value-transferring transaction creates a new account   |
| `STATE_UPDATE`             |  1,000 | One account-leaf write in the account trie (nonce and balance coalesce) |
| `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_CODE`   |  2,600 | Cold touch of an account with code                                      |
| `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE` |    500 | Cold touch of an account known to have no code                          |
| `WARM_STATE_READ`          |    100 | Touch of an already-warm account                                        |

Notes:

- `STATE_UPDATE` counts writes at the account-leaf granularity. If a single account's nonce and balance both change in one transition, charge one `STATE_UPDATE`.
- `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE` reflects that non-code accounts do not load code or a storage trie, so have a lower warming cost.
- A regular ETH transfer additionally includes a cold touch of at least `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE` and a `STATE_UPDATE` of the `to` address, so the effective minimal productive tx cost is `6,000`.
- Not including the `to` cold warming and `STATE_UPDATE` in `TX_BASE_COST` means a contract-interaction transaction that does not transfer value does not unnecessarily pay these additional costs.

### Derivation (non-normative)

Decomposition of the base cost into universal primitives:

| Component                |  Cost | Notes                                              |
| ------------------------ | ----: | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ECRECOVER                | 3,000 | Elliptic curve signature recovery                  |
| STATE_UPDATE             | 1,000 | One account-leaf write (nonce + balance coalesced) |
| COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE |   500 | Sender is cold and has no code                     |
|                          |       |                                                    |
| TX_BASE_COST             | 4,500 | Sum of above (3,000 + 1,000 + 500)                 |


### New-account surcharge

Apply `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT` when **all** are true:

1. The transaction is not a `CREATE` transaction.
2. `value > 0`.
3. `to` is not a precompile.
4. `to` is non-existent per [EIP-161](./eip-161.md) emptiness at the start of transaction execution.

If these conditions hold the transfer results in account creation and `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT` is added to the **intrinsic** gas. Execution additionally pays exactly one `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE` for the recipient; no code-load cost applies.

For reference, the **total** charges for such transfers change from 21,000 to 30,000.

| Component                | Cost   | Notes                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------:| ---------------------------------------- |
| TX_BASE_COST             | 4,500  | Base transaction cost                    |
| COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE | 500    | Recipient cold lookup (execution charge) |
| GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT          | 25,000 | Account creation, includes leaf write    |
|                          |        |                                          |
| Total                    | 30,000 | Sum of above (4,500 + 500 + 25,000)      |

Notes:

- If `value = 0` and `to` is empty per [EIP-161](./eip-161.md), no account is created and no surcharge applies.
- `CREATE` transactions are unchanged; their cost already includes account creation.

### Intrinsic gas computation

Clients compute intrinsic gas as today for each typed transaction **except**:

- Replace any hardcoded `21,000` with `TX_BASE_COST = 4,500`.
- Add `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT` when the *New-account surcharge* conditions hold.

### Pseudocode (normative):

```text
function CalculateIntrinsicGas(tx, state_at_start):
    gasCost = TX_BASE_COST

    // Existing rules for calldata and access lists remain unchanged by this EIP.
    gasCost += GasForCalldata(tx.data)                  // per active calldata pricing EIPs
    if tx.has_access_list():
        gasCost += GasForAccessList(tx.access_list)     // per EIP-2930

    if tx.is_create() == false
       and tx.value > 0
       and is_precompile(tx.to) == false
       and is_nonexistent_per_eip161(state_at_start, tx.to):
        gasCost += GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT

    return gasCost
```

### EVM gas schedule adjustments

These changes refine execution-layer accounting to align with the primitives above.

- **Value-moving calls.** Replace the legacy `CALL_VALUE_COST = 9,000` with:

  - If recipient exists: `CALL_VALUE_COST = 2 * STATE_UPDATE = 2,000`.
  - If recipient is EIP-161-empty: `CALL_VALUE_COST = STATE_UPDATE + GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT = 26,000`.
  - This charge is in addition to warm/cold account-touch costs per EIP-2929 and the existing `CALL` base cost. This EIP does not modify the `CALL` base cost.

- **Cold-account touches.**

  - Use `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_CODE = 2,600` when touching an account with code.
  - Use `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE = 500` when touching an account known to have no code.

- **Warmth policy.**

  - Access-list entries (charged via [EIP-2930](./eip-2930.md)) and precompiles are warm at tx start.
  - `CALL` warms its `to` after charging the appropriate cold cost if cold.
  - A `PAY`-style pure value-move primitive, if present, does not warm its recipient and never loads code. It pays `WARM_STATE_READ = 100` if warm for unrelated reasons, else `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE = 500`, plus the value-write cost above.

- **Self-transfers.** If `from == to` then only one `STATE_UPDATE` occurs which is already factored into `TX_BASE_COST` as part of gas charge and nonce change, so only `TX_BASE_COST` is charged.

### Transaction reference cases

| Case                                | Formula                                                          | Total Cost                |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------:|
| (NOP) No-transfer to EOA            | `TX_BASE_COST`                                                   | 4,500                 |
| (NOP) No-transfer to empty account  | `TX_BASE_COST`                                                   | 4,500                 |
| (NOP) ETH transfer to self          | `TX_BASE_COST`                                                   | 4,500                 |
| ETH Transfer to existing EOA        | `TX_BASE_COST` + `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE` + `STATE_UPDATE`       | 6,000                 |
| No-transfer to contract             | `TX_BASE_COST` + `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_CODE` + **execution**                | 7,100 + **execution**     |
| ETH Transfer to contract            | `TX_BASE_COST` + `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_CODE` + `STATE_UPDATE` + **execution** | 8,100 + **execution**     |
| ETH Transfer creating new account   | `TX_BASE_COST` + `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE` + `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT`        | 30,000                |

This aligns costs with actual state work rather than legacy flat surcharges.

### Edits and interactions with other EIPs

- **[EIP-2930](./eip-2930.md) (Access List).** Intrinsic gas is `TX_BASE_COST` after `FORK_BLOCK`. Access lists keep their existing per-entry charges and warming semantics.
- **[EIP-2929](./eip-2929.md) (Gas cost increases for state access).** Refined by this EIP to price non-code cold touches at `500` and code-account cold touches at `2,600`.
- **[EIP-7702](./eip-7702.md) (Set EOA Code).** Intrinsic gas uses `TX_BASE_COST`. Warmth rules are unchanged; if 7702 supplies code via the tx, clients need not fetch code from disk to decide between `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_CODE` and `COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NONCODE` for the initial touch.
- **Calldata-pricing EIPs (e.g. [EIP-7623](./eip-7623.md)).** Unchanged. This EIP does not alter calldata pricing.

## Test Cases

While the benefits of reducing transactions' intrinsic cost are apparent, such a change should be applied if it imposes no negative externalities, or if such effects are negligible.

Tests should be created with blocks of just ETH transfers and tested on Perfnet across all EL clients to ensure the pricing is correct.

Add explicit test vectors (intrinsic gas only):

1. `value > 0` to an empty EOA (non-existent per EIP-161): intrinsic `30,000` (4,500 base + 500 + 25,000 surcharge).
2. `value > 0` to a precompile: intrinsic `4,500` (no surcharge; precompiles are warm at tx start).
3. `value = 0` to an empty address: intrinsic `4,500` (no creation, no surcharge).
4. `CREATE` transaction: unchanged from prior rules.
5. EIP-7702 transaction with and without access list: intrinsic uses `TX_BASE_COST` plus unchanged access-list costs.
6. Block of txs calling minimal gas contract execution with maximal contract size addresses (so VM is activated for every tx).

## Rationale

Price only what every transaction always does: ECDSA recovery, warming `sender` and `to`, and one account-leaf write for the sender (nonce + balance change). That sums to `4,500` gas. Anything not universal should be metered separately.

Calldata remains metered per byte. No calldata allowance is folded into the base. This reinforces ETH as money and payments: a plain ETH transfer carries no calldata, executes no bytecode, and touches no contract storage slots. It adds exactly one recipient touch (when not a smart contract) and one recipient leaf write, so its total is `6,000`.

When a value transfer creates a previously empty account, charge `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT = 25,000`, identical to `CALL` account-creation pricing. `CREATE` is unchanged because its cost already includes account creation. Access-list pricing is unchanged.

This removes cross-subsidies, aligns charges with resources, and keeps costs equal across paths that perform the same state growth.

Do not fold any calldata allowance into the base. The envelope RLP (`nonce`, `gas*`, `to`, `value`, `v`, `r`, `s`) is not charged as calldata and remains unmetered per byte. Only `tx.data` bytes are metered at the existing calldata schedule, and access lists keep their per-entry costs. A vanilla ETH transfer executes no bytecode and touches no contract storage slots; it performs signature recovery, warms the sender, and updates sender and recipient accounts. It therefore receives the base discount and pays only the additional recipient costs.

Bundling multiple transfers into a single contract call avoids repeated `TX_BASE_COST`, but those transfers then execute serially inside one EVM context. That blocks parallel execution. With a lower per-tx base cost, users have less incentive to bundle, so more transfers remain independent transactions. Independent transactions can be scheduled across threads, which improves parallelism at the client and execution-layer level.

Thus, reducing `TX_BASE_COST` not only corrects mispricing but also increases the share of transactions that are naturally parallelizable.

### Why not charge full tx data as calldata?

- **Intrinsic coupling to signed fields.** Pricing full-transaction bytes would make intrinsic gas depend on `gas_limit` and variable-length signature elements, creating fixed-point estimation issues and incentives for signature-length selection as well as iteration unstablity as `gas_limit` depends on signiture which contains `gas_limit`.

- **Serialization neutrality.** A fee rule keyed to RLP size couples costs to one encoding and weakens [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) type neutrality and future formats such as SSZ. Calldata is treated as opaque bytes so it avoids this coupling.

- **Policy targeting and market floor.** Calldata floors (for example [EIP-7623](./eip-7623.md) or [EIP-7976](./eip-7976.md)) price bytes in `tx.data` to bound EL payload and steer data to blobs; envelope bytes are control-plane. The `TX_BASE_COST` is the smallest tx size, and having a low encoding-agnostic intrinsic base keeps the minimum inclusion price coupled to the basefee market, without opening a DoS vector.

- **Native settlement and unit-of-account.** Even though all transactions receive the same absolute gas reduction, it proportionally improves pristine ETH transfers more. With an ETH transfer at ~6,000 gas vs a permissioned ERC-20/LST/stablecoin transfer at ~48,000 gas, you get ~8x higher payment throughput per unit gas, which reinforces ETH as the settlement asset and reduces reliance on contract-based money (which carries smart contract risk, operator risk, governance risk and censorship risks via smart contract operator).

### Effects on transactions per block

For execution-payload size, use [EIP-7934](./eip-7934.md)’s 8 MiB uncompressed cap: `8,388,608 bytes`. A typical EIP-1559 ETH transfer encodes at roughly `~110 bytes`, yielding a size cap of `floor(8,388,608 / 110) = 76,260 tx` per block when size, not gas, is the binding constraint.

There are two useful ceilings to consider:

* Minimal transaction with no value and no execution: `TX_BASE_COST = 4,500` gas.
* Minimal ETH payment to an existing EOA: `6,000` gas (`TX_BASE_COST + COLD_ACCOUNT_COST_NOCODE + STATE_UPDATE`).

Counts below are `floor(gaslimit / per-tx-gas)`, then capped by `76,260` when the 8 MiB size limit binds. TPS figures round to the nearest integer.

#### Scenario A: minimal txs at 4,500 gas

Binding point for size-cap dominance: `76,260 * 4,500 = 343,170,000` gas. At gaslimits above ~343.17 M, block size, not gas, limits the tx count for 4,500-gas transactions.

| Block gaslimit | Old tx/bk (21k) | New tx/bk (4.5k) | TPS @ 12s | TPS @ 6s | TPS @ 3s | TPS @ 1.5s |
| -------------: | --------------: | ---------------: | --------: | -------: | -------: | ---------: |
|           45 M |           2,142 |           10,000 |       833 |    1,667 |    3,333 |      6,667 |
|           60 M |           2,857 |           13,333 |     1,111 |    2,222 |    4,444 |      8,889 |
|          100 M |           4,761 |           22,222 |     1,852 |    3,704 |    7,407 |     14,815 |
|          200 M |           9,523 |           44,444 |     3,704 |    7,407 |   14,815 |     29,629 |
|          450 M |          21,428 |          *76,260 |     6,355 |   12,710 |   25,420 |     50,840 |

* Size cap binds at 450 M because 450 M > 343.17 M.

#### Scenario B: ETH transfers at 6,000 gas

Binding point for size-cap dominance: `76,260 * 6,000 = 457,560,000` gas. At gaslimits below ~457.56 M, gas limits tx count; above it, the 8 MiB size cap dominates.

|           45 M |           2,142 |          7,500 |       625 |    1,250 |    2,500 |      5,000 |
|           60 M |           2,857 |         10,000 |       833 |    1,667 |    3,333 |      6,667 |
|          100 M |           4,761 |         16,666 |     1,389 |    2,778 |    5,555 |     11,111 |
|          200 M |           9,523 |         33,333 |     2,778 |    5,556 |   11,111 |     22,222 |
|          450 M |          21,428 |         75,000 |     6,250 |   12,500 |   25,000 |     50,000 |

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is **not** backward compatible. It is a consensus gas repricing that must be activated at `FORK_BLOCK`.

Wallets, RPCs, gas estimators, and any logic that assumes a `21,000` base must update.

## Security Considerations

As this significantly increases the max tx per block this carries risk.

However this pricing should be the same as performing the component changes inside the transaction; and it factors in the additional costs from state growth which were not originally in the transaction base price.

Current gaslimit testing mostly uses a block with a single transaction; so this should not cause unexpected load compared to what is already being tested.
