## Abstract

This proposal introduces the **RE-EN encryption standard**, a quantum-resistant encryption algorithm designed to secure Ethereum transactions, smart contracts, and decentralized data against the potential risks posed by quantum computing. It aims to replace or supplement current cryptographic methods like elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) with a more future-proof solution. RE-EN also enables unprecedented **data compression**, converting an infinite-length cipher with nearly 100.0% compression level, ensuring efficiency in the Ethereum ecosystem. It also ensures robust security by avoiding vulnerabilities present in traditional hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA256, etc., which are susceptible to quantum attacks. **RE-EN can also be used for blockchain encryption, except for SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512, efficiently and securely.**

## Motivation

With the advancement of quantum computing, many current encryption standards are at risk of being compromised. Ethereum relies heavily on ECC for securing transactions and smart contracts, which could be vulnerable to quantum attacks. RE-EN aims to provide a **robust encryption system** that ensures Ethereum’s security in a quantum-powered future, safeguarding user assets, network integrity, and enabling **high-efficiency encryption**. It also provides a **compression feature** that reduces cipher size, improving storage and transmission efficiency.

## Specification

The RE-EN encryption system leverages **post-quantum cryptographic algorithms** that are resistant to known quantum computing attacks. Key features include:

- **Quantum-Resistant Key Generation**: Utilizes lattice-based encryption techniques to generate secure keys that remain robust even in the presence of quantum computers.
- **Transaction Integrity**: Ensures that Ethereum transactions remain tamper-proof and verifiable even in a quantum environment.
- **Data Compression**: Converts an infinite-length cipher near to 100.0% compression level, significantly reducing storage and transmission requirements. The compression technique utilizes advanced algorithms to ensure that data integrity is preserved while enhancing transmission efficiency.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Designed to work alongside current cryptographic methods until quantum computing becomes a significant threat. Ethereum clients can adopt RE-EN without disrupting the network.
- **Blockchain Encryption**: RE-EN can be used efficiently and securely for blockchain encryption, except for SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512, which are already well-optimized for current cryptographic standards.

The encryption standard includes key management, encryption/decryption procedures, and compatibility with Ethereum’s existing smart contract functionality.

## Rationale

The motivation behind RE-EN is the growing concern over the future impact of quantum computing on current cryptographic methods. While the transition to quantum-resistant systems will take time, adopting RE-EN now allows Ethereum to gradually prepare for the quantum era. RE-EN’s **quantum resistance**, coupled with its **ability to compress data efficiently**, provides a balance between performance, security, and storage optimization, making it ideal for Ethereum’s decentralized ecosystem.

## Backwards Compatibility

RE-EN encryption is **backward compatible** with existing Ethereum systems. It can operate alongside ECC, allowing smart contracts and transactions to function as they currently do, while providing an upgrade path for quantum-resistant security. Ethereum clients can incorporate RE-EN without requiring a hard fork or breaking existing contracts.

## Test Cases

The test cases for RE-EN encryption involve:
1. **Key Generation**: Verifying the correct generation and storage of quantum-resistant keys.
2. **Transaction Signing**: Ensuring that RE-EN can securely sign and verify Ethereum transactions.
3. **Integration with Smart Contracts**: Testing compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts to ensure no disruption in normal operations.
4. **Quantum Attack Simulation**: Assessing the resilience of RE-EN encryption under simulated quantum computing attacks.
5. **Data Compression**: Validating the correct conversion of long ciphers into set of characters with near to 100.0% compression level, ensuring efficiency in storage and transmission.
6. **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure the impact of RE-EN on transaction and block validation speeds across different Ethereum clients.

## Security Considerations

While RE-EN encryption is designed to be resistant to quantum attacks, it is important to continuously assess its security as quantum computing advances. Potential risks include the evolution of more powerful quantum algorithms that may eventually break current post-quantum techniques. Regular updates and improvements will be necessary to maintain the system’s robustness. Currently a quantum computer would need infeasible amount of qubits to break the encryption also.

Potential security considerations include:
- **Key Management**: Ensuring that keys are securely generated, stored, and rotated to prevent compromise.
- **Performance**: Post-quantum algorithms may introduce performance overheads that need to be optimized for Ethereum’s decentralized network.
- **Adoption Path**: Gradual adoption of RE-EN will require careful planning to ensure no vulnerabilities are introduced during the transition phase.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring that compression of data does not affect the integrity or authenticity of encrypted data.
