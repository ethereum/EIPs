## Abstract

EOF sections and EVM instructions are introduced to provide procedural entry points to code sections.

## Motivation

Currently the Ethereum Object Format supports a single code section, with no further means of structuring the code.

This proposal adds a layer of structure by supporting additional code sections.  How to access these sections?  This proposal specifies a table of entry points for each additional section.  Each entry point corresponds to a procedure within a code section.

We define procedures as blocks of code that can be entered only at their entry point, and at other points can call other procedures and subroutines and return to the procedure that called them.

## Specification

### EOF Sections

Code sections after the first must be immediately preceded by an entry point section.  These sections can only be entered at one of the specified entry points in the code section, given as an offset relative to the beginning of the code section.

#### Entry Point Section

| description| | length  ||
|------------|--|---------|-|
| section_kind|  | 1-byte  | Encoded as a 8-bit unsigned number. |
| section_size | | 2-bytes | Encoded as a 16-bit unsigned big-endian number. |
| entry_array | [] |
| | entry_point  | 2-bytes | Encoded as a 16-bit unsigned big-endian number. |
| | ... | ... | ... |

### Call Frame Stack

These instructions make use of a `frame stack` to allocate and free frames of data for procedures in memory.  Frame memory begins at address 0 in memory and grows downwards, towards more negative addresses.  A frame is allocated for each procedure when it is called, and freed when it returns. 

Memory can be addressed relative to the frame pointer `FP` or by absolute address.  `FP` starts at 0, and moves downward to point just after end of the frame for each `CALLPROC`, and to the start of that frame -- which is just past the end of the previous frame -- for a corresponding `RETURNPROC`.

For example, on entry to a procedure needing two words of data the `frame stack` might look like this

```
     0-> . . . .
         . . . .
    FP->
```
Then, on entry to a called procedure needing three words of data the `frame stack` would like this

```
     0-> . . . .
         . . . .
    64-> . . . .
         . . . .
         . . . .
    FP->
```
On return from that procedure the `frame stack` would like this
```
     0-> . . . .
         . . . .
    FP-> . . . .
         . . . .
         . . . .
```
And after another return
```
    FP-> . . . .
         . . . .
         . . . .
         . . . .
         . . . .
```

### Instructions

#### ENTERPROC (0x??) n_inputs: uint2, n_outputs: uint2, n_locals: uint2
> Marks the entry point to a procedure taking `n_inputs` arguments from the data stack, returning `n_outputs` values on the `data stack`, and reserving `n_locals` words of data in memory on the `frame stack`. Procedures can only be entered via a `CALLPROC` to their entry point.
>
> Execution of `ENTERPROC` is invalid.

#### LEAVEPROC (0x??)
> Marks the end of a procedure.  Each `ENTERPROC` requires a closing `LEAVEPROC`.
>
> Execution of `LEAVEPROC` from within the procedure it ends is equivalent to `RETURNPROC`.  Otherwise it is invalid.


#### CALLPROC (0x??) code_id: byte, entry_point: byte
 ```
   frame_stack.push(FP)
   FP -= frame_size * 32
   dest = (address of code_id section) + (entry_point offset) + 1
   asm JUMPSUB dest
```
> Push `FP` on the `frame stack`, set `FP` to point just past the new frame, then call the indicated procedure using `JUMPSUB`.
>
> The `code_id` indexes each `entry_array` in order, from 1, except that `code_id=0` means the current section.
> The `entry_point` indexes procedures in order of `entery_point` in the `entry_array` in the section, from 0.*
> 
> *Note: The required `n_inputs` words are known at validation time to be available on the `data stack`.* 

#### RETURNPROC (0x??)
```
   FP = frame_stack.pop()
   asm RETURNSUB
```
> Pop the `frame stack` and return to the calling procedure using `RETURNSUB`.

The promised `n_outputs` words are known (at validation time) to be available on the frame stack. 

#### MSTOREFP (0x??) offset: int2
```
*(u256*)(FP + offset) = *SP--
```
> Pop a word from the top of the data stack to memory at `FP + offset`, decreasing stack size by one word.  

#### MLOADFP (0x??) offset: int2, n_words: uint2
```
*SP++ = *(u256*)(FP + offset)
```
> Push a word to the top of the data stack from memory at `FP + offset`, increasing stack size by one word.

#### GETFP (0x??)
```
*SP++ = FP
```
> Push `FP` to the top of the data stack, increasing stack size by one word.

### Memory Costs

Presently,`MSTORE` is defined as
```
   memory[stack[0]...(stack[0]+31) := stack[1]
   memory_size' = max(memory_size,floor(stack[0]+32)÷32))
```
where `memory_size` is the number of active words of memory above 0.

We propose to treat memory addresses as signed, so the formula for `MSTOREFP` needs to be
```
memory'[stack[0]...(stack[0]+31) ≡ stack[1]
  if (stack[0])+32)÷32) < 0
     negative_memory_size' = max(negative_memory_size,floor(-(stack[0])+32)÷32))
  else
     positive_memory_size' = max(positive_memory_size,floor((stack[0])+32)÷32))
```
where `negative_memory_size` is the number of active words of memory below 0, and `positive_memory_size` is the number of active words of memory above 0.

## Rationale

There is actually not much new here.  It amounts to [EIP-615](./eip-615), broken into bite-sized pieces.

This proposal uses the [EIP-2315](./eip-2315) return stack to manage calls and returns, and steals existing ideas from [EIP-615](./eip-615), [EIP-3336](./eip-3336) and [EIP-3337](./eip-3337). `ENTERPROC` is loosely modeled on `BEGINSUB`.  Per EIP-3336 and EIP-3337 it moves call frames from the data stack to memory. Per EIP-615 it uses a frame stack to track call-frame addresses with `FP` as procedures are entered and left.

*Note: The aliasing of the frame stack with ordinary memory supports the addressing of call frame data with ordinary stores and loads.  This is generally useful, especially for languages like C that provide pointers to variables on the stack.*

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal adds new EOF sections and EVM opcodes.  It doesn't remove or change the semantics of any existing opcodes, so there should be no backwards compatibility issues.

## Security

Safe use of these constructs can be checked completely at validation time -- per EIP-3779 -- so there should be no security issues.
