## Simple Summary
In the context of Computation Integrity Proof (CIP) Layer-2 solutions such as ZK-Rollups, users are required to sign messages on new elliptic curves optimized for those environnements. These curves are Baby Jubjub (in the context of the BN254 SNARK approach) and Arya in (the context of StarkEx). Extensive work has been done to provide secure ways to derive private keys. We leverage this work to define an efficient way to securely derive private keys from existing infrastructure, as well as creating domain separation between Layer-2 applications.

## Abstract
We provide a Derivation Path allowing a user to derive hierarchical keys for Layer-2 solutions depending on the zk-technology, the application, the user’s Layer-1 address, as well as an efficient grinding method to enforce the private key distribution within the curve domain.

## Specification
Starkware keys are derived with the following [BIP43](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0043.mediawiki)-compatible derivation path, with direct inspiration from [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki):
```
m / purpose' / layer' / application' / eth_address_1' / eth_address_2' / index
```
where:
* `m` - the seed.
* `purpose` - `2545` (the number of this EIP).
* `layer` - the 31 lowest bits of sha2 on the plugin name. Serve as a domain seperator between different technologies.
* `application` - the 31 lowest bits of sha2 of the application name. Serve as a domain seperator between different applications.
* `eth_address_1 / eth_address_2` - the first and second 31 lowest bits of the corresponding eth_address.
* `index` - to allow multiple keys per eth_address.

The key derivation should follow the following algorithm
```
N = secp256k1 curve order
n = Layer2 curve order								
path = stark derivation path
BIP32() = Official BIP-0032 derivation function on secp256k1
hash = SHA256
i = 0
root_key = BIP32(path)
while True:
	key = hash(root_key|i)
	if (key < (N - (N % n))):
		return key % n
	i++
```
This algorithm has been defined to maintain efficiency on existing restricted devices. 

Nota Bene: At each round, the probability for a key to be greater than (N - (N % n)) is < 2^(-5).

## Rationale
This EIP specifies two aspects of keys derivation in the context of Hierarchical Wallets:
- Derivation Path
- Grinding Algorithm to enforce a uniform distribution over the elliptic curve.
The derivation path is defined to allow efficient keys separation based on technology and application while maintaining a 1-1 relation with the Layer-1 wallet. In such a way, losing EIP-2645 wallets falls back to losing the Layer-1 wallet.

## Backwards Compatibility
This standard is backward compatible with BIP43.

## Security Considerations
As explained previously, this EIP has been defined to maintain separation of keys while providing foolproof logic on key derivation.
