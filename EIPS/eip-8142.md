## Abstract

zkEVMs allow validators to verify the correctness of an execution payload using a proof, without downloading or executing the payload itself. However, removing the requirement to download the execution payload, also removes the implicit data availability (DA) guarantee; a block producer can publish a valid proof and withhold the execution-payload data since attesters no longer need them for consensus.

This EIP introduces Block-in-Blobs (BiB), a mechanism that requires the execution-payload data (transactions and BALs) to be published in blob data, in the same beacon block that carries the corresponding execution payload's header. This ensures that execution payloads and their associated data are always published even when validators no longer require them to verify the state transition function (STF).

In short, BiB works by having the block producer encode the execution-payload data into blobs as part of the execution layer's STF, requiring the beacon block’s blob KZG commitments to commit to those payload-blobs.

## Motivation

**Validation via re-execution**

Today, validators verify execution payloads by:

1) Downloading the execution payload
2) Executing the payload locally
3) Checking the resulting state root and other fields against the fields in the header

Implicitly this guarantees execution payload availability because the payload cannot be verified unless the node downloads it.

**Validation with zkEVMs**

With zkEVMs, validators instead:

1) Download a proof attesting to the correctness of the execution payload
2) Download the execution payload header
3) Verify the proof with respects to the payload header (and other commitments)

In this model, validators no longer require access to the full execution payload data itself in order to verify its correctness.

**The DA problem**

Removing the re-execution requirement in consensus removes the implicit requirement that consensus clients download the execution payload.

A malicious or rational builder could:

- Publish a valid proof for a valid execution payload
- Withhold the execution-payload data entirely

*Builders*: Since builders will always need to re-execute in order to build blocks, a malicious builder would not publish the execution payload ensuring that they are the only ones that can build on top of the current chain.

*RPC and indexers*: Many nodes such as RPC providers and indexers cannot solely rely on execution proofs and must re-execute the execution payload.

BiB addresses this by making the execution payload available via blobs.

## Specification

### Terminology

**Type-3 transaction:** Refers to EIP-4844 blob-carrying transactions (transaction type 0x03). These transactions include blob versioned hashes that commit to blobs carrying user data.

### Overview and Invariants

BiB ensures the proven payload is published:

- The beacon block references a list of blob KZG commitments (via 4844/PeerDas)
- A prefix of those commitments is reserved for the execution-payload data encoded into blobs
- A zkEVM proof for the block must bind the proven execution payload to those prefixed blob commitments.

**Payload availability invariant:** A valid block implies there exists an ordered list of blobs whose bytes decode to the canonical execution-payload data, and the KZG commitments for these blobs match the first `payload_blob_count` blob commitments referenced by the block. The existing DAS mechanism will ensure that those blobs are available.

### Parameters

#### Referenced Parameters

These parameters are defined in EIP-4844 and related specs:

| Name | Value | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| `FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB` | `4096` | EIP-4844 |
| `BYTES_PER_FIELD_ELEMENT` | `32` | EIP-4844 |
| `GAS_PER_BLOB` | `2**17` | EIP-4844 |
| `MAX_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK` | Network-specific | EIP-7892 |

**Note on `MAX_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK`:** This constant represents the maximum number of blobs (both payload-blobs and type-3 transaction blobs) that can be included in a block. Per EIP-7892, the execution layer's `blobSchedule.max` MUST equal the consensus layer's `MAX_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK` configuration value at any given time. This value may change across forks (e.g., initially 6 in EIP-4844, potentially increased in subsequent blob throughput increase proposals).

#### Derived Constants

| Name | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `USABLE_BYTES_PER_FIELD_ELEMENT` | `BYTES_PER_FIELD_ELEMENT - 1` (31) | Usable bytes per field element (final byte must be zero to stay under BLS modulus) |
| `USABLE_BYTES_PER_BLOB` | `FIELD_ELEMENTS_PER_BLOB * USABLE_BYTES_PER_FIELD_ELEMENT` | Total usable bytes per blob |

### Execution Layer

**Summary:** The execution layer is modified in the following ways:

- The ExecutionPayloadHeader now has a `payload_blob_count` field to track how many blobs are used for the execution payload data, enabling verification of the correct number of payload-blobs at the Engine API boundary.
- `engine_getPayload` computes the payload-blobs when building a block, sets `payload_blob_count` in the ExecutionPayloadHeader, and returns the payload blobs (with their commitments and proofs) alongside type-3 transaction blobs in the response.
- `engine_newPayload` takes the ExecutionPayload and before passing it to the EL STF, it computes the payload-blobs, checks that the amount of blobs needed is equal to the `payload_blob_count` value in the ExecutionPayloadHeader and verifies that the expected version hashes match.

##### extract_data_from_type_3_tx

This method will be used to implement the modified logic in engine_getPayload.

    """

    Implementation note: This is not new logic - a function(s) like this should already be available in your existing getPayload/blob bundle implementation.
    """
    ...
```

**Invertibility invariant:** `execution_payload_data_to_blobs` and `blobs_to_execution_payload_data` are mutual inverses on valid execution-payload data.

#### Data structures

##### ExecutionPayloadData

**Execution-payload data** refers to the subset of the ExecutionPayload that must be made available via blobs. This includes:

- `bals` (Block Access List added in EIP-7928)
- `transactions`

See [What is included in execution-payload data?](#what-is-included-in-execution-payload-data) in the Rationale for details.

```python
class ExecutionPayloadData(Container):
    # Block Access List (BAL) from EIP-7928, RLP-encoded
    blockAccessList: bytes
    # List of transactions, each transaction is RLP-encoded
    transactions: List[Transaction, MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_PAYLOAD]
```

**Note:** This is not an SSZ Container - fields are RLP-encoded as described in the encoding functions. The `MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_PAYLOAD` bound is inherited from the ExecutionPayload field limit defined in the consensus specification.

##### ExecutionPayloadHeader

This EIP adds a new field to the `ExecutionPayloadHeader`:

- payload_blob_count : uint64

Semantics:

- Let `blob_kzg_commitments` be the ordered list of kzg commitments referenced by the beacon block
- The first `payload_blob_count` entries of `blob_kzg_commitments` are the payload-blob commitments (i.e. commitments to the blobs that correspond to the payload data)
- The remaining entries (if any) are for type-3 blob transactions.

##### BlobsBundle

For the zkEVM-optimized variant of `engine_getPayload`, this EIP extends `BlobsBundle` with an additional field:

- `payload_kzg_proofs`: List[KZGProof]

Semantics:

- Contains random point KZG proofs for payload blobs only (not type-3 transaction blobs)
- Used as private inputs to the zkEVM circuit for payload consistency verification via `verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch`
- The length of this list equals `payload_blob_count`

#### Engine API

This section specifies two equivalent formulations of `new_payload`. Implementers choose one based on their execution context:

- **Native execution variant**: Uses `blob_to_kzg_commitment` directly. Suitable for pre mandatory proofs implementations.
- **zkEVM-optimized variant**: Uses polynomial openings via `verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch`. Avoids the multiscalar multiplication (MSM) which is expensive to prove in a zkEVM circuit.

Both variants enforce identical validity conditions. A block valid under one is valid under the other.

##### engine_getPayload - Native Variant

The builder must compute the payload blob count when constructing the block:

```python
def get_payload(payload_id: PayloadId) -> GetPayloadResponse:
    # 1. Build the block (select transactions, etc.)
    payload = build_execution_payload(payload_id)

    # 2. Compute payload blobs to determine count
    payload_data = get_execution_payload_data(payload)
    payload_blobs = execution_payload_data_to_blobs(payload_data)
    payload_blob_count = len(payload_blobs)

    # 4. Set the count in the header
    payload.payload_blob_count = payload_blob_count

    # 5. Compute blob commitments and cell proofs for payload blobs
    payload_commitments = [blob_to_kzg_commitment(b) for b in payload_blobs]
    payload_versioned_hashes = [kzg_commitment_to_versioned_hash(c) for c in payload_commitments]
    # Compute cells and cell proofs
    payload_cells_and_proofs = [compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs(b) for b in payload_blobs]
    payload_cell_proofs = [proofs for _, proofs in payload_cells_and_proofs]

    # 6. Extract type-3 transaction blobs, commitments, and cell proofs
    type3_blobs, type3_commitments, type3_cell_proofs = extract_data_from_type_3_tx(payload.transactions)
    type3_versioned_hashes = []
    for tx in payload.transactions:
        if tx.type == BLOB_TX_TYPE:
            type3_versioned_hashes.extend(tx.blob_versioned_hashes)

    # 7. Combine: payload blobs first, then type-3 blobs
    all_blobs = payload_blobs + type3_blobs
    all_commitments = payload_commitments + type3_commitments
    all_cell_proofs = payload_cell_proofs + type3_cell_proofs
    all_blob_versioned_hashes = payload_versioned_hashes + type3_versioned_hashes

    return GetPayloadResponse(
        execution_payload=payload,
        blobs_bundle=BlobsBundle(
            commitments=all_commitments,
            blobs=all_blobs,
            proofs=all_cell_proofs
        ),
        block_value=calculate_block_value(payload)
    )
```

Note: The builder must account for payload blob usage when selecting type-3 transactions to ensure the total blob count does not exceed `MAX_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK`.

##### engine_getPayload - zkEVM-Optimized Variant

For the zkEVM-optimized variant, the builder must additionally compute random point KZG proofs for the payload blobs, which will be used as private inputs in the zkEVM circuit for payload consistency verification.

This variant extends `BlobsBundle` with an additional `payload_kzg_proofs` field containing random point KZG proofs for payload blobs.

```python
def get_payload_zk(payload_id: PayloadId) -> GetPayloadResponse:
    # 1. Build the block (select transactions, etc.)
    payload = build_execution_payload(payload_id)

    # 2. Compute payload blobs to determine count
    payload_data = get_execution_payload_data(payload)
    payload_blobs = execution_payload_data_to_blobs(payload_data)
    payload_blob_count = len(payload_blobs)

    # 4. Set the count in the header
    payload.payload_blob_count = payload_blob_count

    # 5. Compute commitments, cell proofs, and random point proofs for payload blobs
    payload_commitments = [blob_to_kzg_commitment(b) for b in payload_blobs]
    payload_versioned_hashes = [kzg_commitment_to_versioned_hash(c) for c in payload_commitments]
    # Cell proofs
    payload_cells_and_proofs = [compute_cells_and_kzg_proofs(b) for b in payload_blobs]
    payload_cell_proofs = [proofs for _, proofs in payload_cells_and_proofs]
    # Random point proofs for payload consistency verification
    payload_random_point_proofs = [compute_blob_kzg_proof(b, c) for b, c in zip(payload_blobs, payload_commitments)]

    # 6. Extract type-3 transaction blobs, commitments, and cell proofs
    type3_blobs, type3_commitments, type3_cell_proofs = extract_data_from_type_3_tx(payload.transactions)
    type3_versioned_hashes = []
    for tx in payload.transactions:
        if tx.type == BLOB_TX_TYPE:
            type3_versioned_hashes.extend(tx.blob_versioned_hashes)

    # 7. Combine: payload blobs first, then type-3 blobs
    all_blobs = payload_blobs + type3_blobs
    all_commitments = payload_commitments + type3_commitments
    all_cell_proofs = payload_cell_proofs + type3_cell_proofs

    return GetPayloadResponse(
        execution_payload=payload,
        blobs_bundle=BlobsBundle(
            commitments=all_commitments,
            blobs=all_blobs,
            proofs=all_cell_proofs,
            payload_kzg_proofs=payload_random_point_proofs
        ),
        block_value=calculate_block_value(payload)
    )
```

**Note for implementors:**

- The `payload_kzg_proofs` field contains KZG opening proofs for payload blobs only. It is used for payload consistency verification via `verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch`.
- The builder/prover should extract the first `payload_blob_count` commitments from `all_commitments` (i.e., `all_commitments[:payload_blob_count]`). This corresponds to the `payload_kzg_commitments` parameter in the zkEVM variant of `engine_newPayload`.

##### engine_newPayload - Native Execution Variant

```python
def new_payload(
    payload: ExecutionPayload,
    expected_blob_versioned_hashes: List[VersionedHash],
    ...
) -> PayloadStatus:

    # 1. Derive payload blobs and commitments
    payload_data = get_execution_payload_data(payload)
    payload_blobs = execution_payload_data_to_blobs(payload_data)
    payload_blob_count = len(payload_blobs)
    payload_commitments = [blob_to_kzg_commitment(b) for b in payload_blobs]
    payload_versioned_hashes = [kzg_commitment_to_versioned_hash(c) for c in payload_commitments]

    # 2. Verify payload_blob_count matches header
    assert payload_blob_count == payload.payload_blob_count

    # 3. Extract type-3 tx versioned hashes
    type3_versioned_hashes = []
    for tx in payload.transactions:
        if tx.type == BLOB_TX_TYPE:
            type3_versioned_hashes.extend(tx.blob_versioned_hashes)

    # 4. Verify versioned hashes: payload blobs first, then type-3
    assert expected_blob_versioned_hashes == payload_versioned_hashes + type3_versioned_hashes

    # 5. Run EL STF
    return execute_payload(payload)
```

##### engine_newPayload - zkEVM-Optimized Variant

**Note:** Once zkEVM proofs are required for consensus, `newPayload` will be executed inside a zkEVM to generate a proof, rather than being executed natively by validators. This variant is designed to be cheaper in that context.

This variant replaces the MSM in `blob_to_kzg_commitment` with polynomial opening proofs, which are cheaper to verify inside a zkEVM. The payload, commitments and KZG proofs are private inputs to the zkEVM circuit, while the corresponding versioned hashes (and payload header) are public inputs.

```python
def new_payload(
    payload: ExecutionPayload,
    expected_blob_versioned_hashes: List[VersionedHash], # public input

    # BiB additions: prefix metadata for payload blobs
    payload_kzg_commitments: List[KZGCommitment],  # private input
    payload_kzg_proofs: List[KZGProof],            # private input
    ...
) -> PayloadStatus:

    # 0. Declared payload blob count from the header
    n = payload.payload_blob_count
    assert len(payload_kzg_commitments) == n
    assert len(payload_kzg_proofs) == n

    # 1. Construct payload blobs from execution-payload data
    payload_data = get_execution_payload_data(payload)
    payload_blobs = execution_payload_data_to_blobs(payload_data)
    assert len(payload_blobs) == n

    # 2. Check the commitments correspond to the expected versioned hash prefix
    payload_versioned_hashes = [
        kzg_commitment_to_versioned_hash(c) for c in payload_kzg_commitments
    ]
    assert expected_blob_versioned_hashes[:n] == payload_versioned_hashes

    # 3. Verify blob–commitment consistency using batch KZG proof verification
    assert verify_blob_kzg_proof_batch(
        blobs=payload_blobs,
        commitments=payload_kzg_commitments,
        proofs=payload_kzg_proofs
    )

    # 4. Proceed with standard EL payload validation / execution
    return execute_payload(payload)
```

### Consensus Layer

#### Validation

The consensus layer does not introduce new blob specific validation rules for payload-blobs beyond what we have for EIP-4844/EIP-7594.

The Consensus Layer relies on `payload_blob_count` in the ExecutionPayloadHeader to interpret the ordering of blob commitments, but otherwise treats payload blobs identically to other blobs for availability and networking.

### Integration with EIP-7732 (ePBS)

This EIP deprecates the `ExecutionPayloadEnvelope` from [EIP-7732](./eip-7732.md). Transactions and BAL are published in blobs; all other payload fields move to `ExecutionPayloadBid`:

```python
class ExecutionPayloadBid(Container):
    # Fields from EIP-7732 (unchanged)

### Networking

BiB reuses the existing blob networking mechanism. Nodes reconstruct the execution payload from the bid (header fields) and blobs (transactions, BAL).

Payload-blobs will not have been propagated before block building, which may imply higher bandwidth requirements from builders.

### Fee Accounting

BiB introduces protocol mandated blob usage, rather than user initiated via type-3 transactions. Fee accounting for payload-blobs differ in nature from transaction blob fees as a result.

#### Who pays?

This EIP does not mandate that payload-blobs pay a per-blob fee like transaction blobs.

Instead payload-blobs are treated as a protocol-accepted cost when constructing the block. In particular:

- Payload-blobs do not correspond to a user transaction and therefore do not naturally map to a user-paid blob fee.
- The cost of including payload-blobs, in terms of blob gas usage, is accepted by the protocol as a necessary cost for maintaining data availability.

#### Do payload-blobs compete with transaction blobs for capacity?

Because payload blobs consume blob gas, they directly influence blob congestion and the blob base fee.

#### Can a builder artificially inflate blob gas usage?

A potential concern is whether a malicious builder could create artificially large execution payloads to inflate blob gas usage.

This attack is economically constrained: to increase the size of the execution payload, a builder must include additional transactions with calldata. Since calldata costs execution gas, the builder would need to pay for this additional data through the normal gas mechanism. The cost of including extra calldata makes it economically unfavorable to artificially inflate payload size solely to manipulate blob fees.

#### Open questions and future considerations

<!-- TODO -->
- Networking related: Payload-blobs require higher bandwidth due to the fact that they will not have been in the public mempool
- Explicit protocol level pricing for payload blobs

## Rationale

### What is included in execution-payload data?

Execution-payload data includes `bals` (Block Access Lists from EIP-7928) and `transactions`.

**Why transactions?** Transaction data is the only component of the execution payload that cannot be derived from other components and is not provided by the consensus layer.

**Why BALs?** While BALs are technically the output of executing transactions and could be recomputed, once zkEVM proofs become mandatory for consensus, validators no longer execute payloads. A malicious builder could publish a valid proof and withhold both the execution payload data and the BALs. This would prevent other builders from constructing subsequent blocks and prevent RPC providers from serving the full state. Including BALs in payload-blobs ensures they remain available.

**Why not withdrawals?** Withdrawals can be derived on the consensus layer.

**Why not execution requests?** Execution requests can be recomputed from transactions and do not suffer from the same withholding attack as BALs because they are required by the consensus layer for validation.

**Why not the header?** The header cannot be put into blobs because it contains `payload_blob_count`, which depends on the number of blobs; causing a circular dependency.

**Encoding optimization:** The encoding includes an 8-byte header: `[4 bytes BAL length] [4 bytes transaction length]`. This allows extracting just the tx data after fetching the first blob.

<!-- TODO -->
TODO: We could also put the number of blobs that the BAL occupies in the execution payload header.

### Builder discretion vs reserving `k` blobs

This EIP specifies that the block builder choose `payload_blob_count`, subject to the constraint imposed by `MAX_BLOBS_PER_BLOCK`.

An alternative would have been to always reserve `k` blobs, where `k` corresponds to the worst case execution payload size. While this provides better predictability, it reduces flexibility under blob congestion.

### Why not encode execution-payload data inside the core EL execution logic?

Doing it in the EL STF would require payload-blob commitments or versioned hashes to be made visible inside the core execution logic, rather than being handled at the Engine API boundary.

### When zkEVM proofs become mandatory, why can't zk-attestors download the full execution payload?

The execution payload grows linearly with the gas limit. Requiring attesters to download the payload for DA would create an increasing bandwidth burden as the gas limit grows. 

### Compression algorithm for encoding execution-payload data

Compression can be used on the serialized execution-payload data. This (in theory) should allow the usage of less payload-blobs, depending on the compression ratio. The tradeoffs being:

- That we will use more CPU/proving cycles for decompression
- A breaking change since we want to decompress on the hot-path. What this means is that the transactions would need to be compressed in the payload, and then decompressed when we attempt to validate it. 

Whether we should use a compression algorithm and which one requires more investigation, in particular we need to investigate:

- The average compression ratios achieved
- The proving cycle overhead
- The invasiveness of now requiring consensus aware objects to be compressed when passed for validation.

For now we recommend using no compression algorithm and operating on uncompressed data.

### Serialization algorithm for encoding execution-payload data

Serialization of the execution-payload data uses RLP. Since transactions in the ExecutionPayload are already RLP-encoded, we simply RLP-encode the list of transaction bytes without any additional transformation.

While a more zk-friendly serialization algorithm could be beneficial in the future, this EIP uses RLP for simplicity. Once EIP-7807 (SSZ execution blocks) is implemented, the encoding can be updated to SSZ-serialize the list of SSZ-encoded transaction bytes.

## Backwards Compatibility

This requires changes to the execution payload header and the EL STF; so requires a fork. Nodes that do not implement BiB will not be able to validate blocks after activation.

## Security Considerations

**Interaction with blob congestion and denial-of-service**

Payload-blobs consume blob gas and therefore are subject to the same congestion control mechanisms and blob limits as transaction blobs.

As a byproduct, this ensures that a malicious block producer cannot make arbitrarily large execution payloads without accounting for blob gas limits. While a block producer could theoretically drive up the blob base fee by creating large payloads, this attack is economically constrained by calldata costs (see [Fee Accounting](#fee-accounting) for details).

**Data withholding**

An attacker cannot withhold execution payload data without also withholding blob data, which would violate existing DAS guarantees and cause the block to be rejected by the consensus layer.
