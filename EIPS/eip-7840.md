## Abstract

Add a new object to client configuration files `blobSchedule` which lists the
target blob count per block and max blob count per block for each fork.

## Motivation

- ensure there is a way to dynamically adjust the target and max blob counts per
  block
- avoid complex handshake over engine API

## Specification

Extend the client configuration files with the object `blobSchedule` with the
following shape:

```json
"blobSchedule": {
  "cancun": {
    "target": 3,
    "max": 6
  },
  "prague": {
    "target": 6,
    "max": 9
  }
}
```

When there is no explicit configuration for the current fork, use the last
specified fork value. If last value is specified, set both to zero.

## Rationale

Although maintaining the target and max blob just in the consensus client is
desirable, we that the reality is execution clients need these values for
various core protocol and peripheral activities. For example, the
`eth_feeHistory` RPC method returns a field `blobGasUsedRatio` that does require
the max, even though the core protocol doesn't specifically need such value.
Passing this value over the engine API every block seem overkill so we believe a
configuration value is a good middle ground.
