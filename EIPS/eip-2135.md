ERC: Consumable Interface

## Simple Summary
An interface marking certain digital assets being consumable. 

## Abstract
The interface identifies functions and events needed for creating a contract to be able to mark a digital asset as "consumable", and react to the request of "consumption".

## Motivation
Being a digital assets sometimes means a consumable power. A most common seen example would be a concert ticket. It will be "consumed" at the moment the ticket-holder use the ticket to get access to enter a concert. 

By having a standard ERC interface, the Ethereum ecosystem can interoperate to provide service, clients, UI, and inter-contract functionalities on top of this very general use-case.

## Specification
The standard will mainly contain the following interfaces.

### The `consume` function
The main function that conducts the consume action.

```solidity

// The main consume function
function consume(uint256 assetId) public returns (bool success);

// The event when a consumption occurs.
event OnConsume(uint256 indexed assetId);

// The interface to check whether an asset is consumable.
function isConsumable(uint256 assetId) public returns (bool consumable);
```


## Rationale

The function `consume` performs the consume action. Being an interface standard, 
this EIP does not impose any assumption of

 - who has the power to perform such activity. 
 - under what condition such consumption can occur.
 
It does, however, assume the asset can be identified in a `uint256` assetId as in th parameter. A design convention and compatibility consideration is put in place to follow the ERC-721

The event notifies subscribers whoever are interested to learn an asset is being consumed. The boolean function of `isConsumable` can be used to check 


## Backwards Compatibility
This interface is designed to be compatible with ERC-721.
