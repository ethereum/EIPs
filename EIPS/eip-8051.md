## Abstract

This proposal adds precompiled contracts that perform signature verifications using the NIST module-lattice signature scheme. Two instantiations are supported:

* **ML-DSA** — NIST-compliant version using SHAKE256 (FIPS-204),
* **ML-DSA-ETH** — EVM-optimized version for cheaper on-chain verification:
    * Uses Keccak-based PRNG instead of SHAKE256 (leverages native KECCAK256 precompile)
    * Stores public-key polynomial `t1` in the NTT domain to skip one NTT during verification (convertible to regular encoding offline)

Two precompile contracts are specified:

* `VERIFY_MLDSA` — verifies a ML-DSA signature compliant to FIPS-204.
* `VERIFY_MLDSA_ETH` — verifies a ML-DSA-ETH signature replacing SHAKE256 with a more efficient hash function, deviating from FIPS-204.

## Motivation

Quantum computers pose a long-term risk to classical cryptographic algorithms. In particular, signature algorithms based on the hardness of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) such as secp256k1, are widely used in Ethereum and threaten by quantum algorithms. This exposes potentially on-chain assets and critical infrastructure to quantum adversaries.

Integrating post-quantum signature schemes is crucial to future-proof Ethereum and other EVM-based environments. It shall be noted that infrastructure for post-quantum signatures should be deployed before quantum adversaries are known to be practical because it takes on the order of years for existing applications to integrate.

Dilithium, a lattice-based scheme standardized by NIST as FIPS-204, offers high security against both classical and quantum adversaries. As the main winner of the standardization, the scheme has been selected as the main alternative to elliptic curve signature algorithms, making it a serious option for Ethereum.

While the signature size (2.4kB) and public key size (1.3kB) are larger than other post-quantum candidates such as Falcon FN-DSA, this scheme is more flexible in terms of parameters. It is thus possible to derive a zero-knowledge version of Dilithium, keeping the security of the scheme together with an efficient in-circuit verification. This EIP does not dig into details this instance.

ML-DSA has a simpler signer algorithm than FN-DSA, making hardware implementation easier.
Finally, ML-DSA is based on the same mathematical construction as Kyber, the Post-Quantum Key Exchange algorithm standardized by NIST as FIPS-203.
All these properties make ML-DSA well-suited for blockchain applications.

In the context of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, a precompile for Keccak256 hash function is already available, making ML-DSA verification much faster when instantiated with an extendable output function derived from Keccak than with SHAKE256, as specified in NIST submission. This EIP specifies two version of ML-DSA enabling two important features: one version being fully compliant with the NIST specification, the other deviating in encodings to reduce the gas cost.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

The following specification provides two precompiled contract:

|**Precompiled contract**|**1**|**2**|
|-|-|-|
|**Name**|`MLDSA_VERIFY`|`MLDSA_VERIFY_ETH`|
|**Address**| 0x12| 0x13|
|**Gas cost**|  4500| 4500|

While ML-DSA can be instantiated for three security levels: NIST level II, III and IV, this EIP only covers NIST level II, corresponding to 128 bits of security.

For the two variants of ML-DSA of this EIP, the following parameters are fixed:

* Polynomial degree: `n = 256`,
* Field modulus: `q = 8380417`,
* Matrix dimensions: `k=4`, `l=4`,
* Bounds of rejection: `γ_1 = 2¹⁷`, `γ_2 = (q-1)/88`,
* Additional parameters: `η = 2`, `τ = 39`, `d = 13`.

These parameters strictly follows NIST. More precisely, `q`, `n`, `k`, `l` and `η` are chosen in order to ensure a hard MLWE related problem, and the remaining parameters are chosen for the hardness of MSIS as well as for the efficiency of the scheme.

In terms of storage, ML-DSA public key can be derived by the verifier, making the overall public key of 1312 bytes. However, this increases the verifier cost, making the on-chain verification too expensive from a practical point of view. In this EIP, the verification algorithm takes the public key in raw format, meaning that the storage for the public key is:

* The full matrix `A_hat` of 16 384 bytes,
* `tr` is stored in order to save one hash, with 32 bytes,
* `t1` is stored in the NTT domain in order to save one NTT, with 4096 bytes.

The overall storage for the **public key** is **20512 bytes**. The signature follows the same format as specified in FIPS-204: 32 bytes for `c_tilde`, 2304 bytes for the coefficients of `z`, and 84 bytes for `h`. In total, a **signature** requires **2420 bytes**.

### Sub-algorithms of ML-DSA

#### Number Theoretic Transform

Polynomial arithmetic is computed efficiency using Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). Efficient polynomial multiplication can be implemented following the draft NTT EIP. NTT inverse cost is roughly the same as an NTT: $n\log(n)$ additions and $n/2 \log(n)$ multiplications over the field $\mathbb F_q$, where $q=8380417$ and $n=256$.

#### EXtendable Output Function

The verification algorithm requires an eXtendable Output Function (XOF) made from a hash function.
This EIP provides two instantiations of a XOF:

* SHAKE256 is the XOF provided in NIST submission, a sponge construction derived from SHA256. Extracting bytes using SHAKE256 calls the `Keccak_f` permutation as described in Section 3.7 of FIPS-204. While this construction is standardized, it is expensive when computed in the Ethereum Virtual Machine because `Keccak_f` has no EVM opcode.
* Keccak-PRNG is a XOF that is build from a counter-mode PRNG based on Keccak256. Generating new chunks of bytes requires an incrementing counter, as described in NIST SP800-90A revision 1. This XOF has the same interface as SHAKE256, but requires a `flip()` function that initiate a counter to `0`. Then, the `squeeze` function outputs as many bytes as needed using a counter mode as specified in SP800-90A revision 1. A precompile of `Keccak256` is available in the Ethereum Virtual Machine, making this XOF very efficient in the EVM.

#### Hints in ML-DSA

ML-DSA requires some hint computation. More precisely, the function `use_hint` must be implemented following Algorithm 40 of FIPS-204. The output hint is a polynomial with coefficients in {0,1}. Another function `sum_hint` is required, and counts the number of non-zero values of the hint.

#### Sample In Ball Challenge

In ML-DSA, a challenge is computed using a XOF.
This algorithm `sample_in_ball` outputs a polynomial with τ small coefficients (in {-1,1}).
The values of the coefficients as well as the position in the coefficients list is obtained using the XOF, as specified in Algorithm 29 of FIPS-204.

### ML-DSA verification algorithm

Verifying a ML-DSA signature follows Algorithm 8 of FIPS-204, with `A_hat` of the public key stored in expanded format, and `t1` stored in the NTT domain.

```python
def VERIFY_MLDSA(public_key, message, signature) -> bool:
    A_hat, tr, t1 are decoded from public_key
    c_tilde, z, h are decoded from signature
    if h is not properly encoded, return False

    μ = shake_256(tr+m).extract(64)
    c = sample_in_ball(c_tilde, τ)
    # computed in the NTT domain
    # three NTTs for c and z, and t1
    # one final inverse NTT.
    Az_minus_ct1 = A_hat * z - c * (2^d * t1)

    w_prime = h.use_hint(Az_minus_ct1, 2*γ_2)

    return check_norm_bound(z, γ_1 - β) and c_tilde == shake_256(μ + w_prime).extract(32)
```

### ML-DSA-ETH verification algorithm

The verification of ML-DSA-ETH signatures follows the same algorithm with another hash function, with two differences:

* `t1` from the public key is stored in the NTT domain in order to save one NTT. The multiplication by `2^d` is also precomputed. Note that this change can be seen as a change of representation.
* A variant of `sample_in_ball` is defined using KeccakPRNG. The only difference from Algorithm 29 of FIPS-204 is that it requires a `flip()` between lines 3 and 4 so that it initializes the counter to `0` before starting squeezing. Note that this can be implemented in `absorb()` and `squeeze()` so that the same interface can be used as in SHAKE256.

```python
def VERIFY_MLDSA_ETH(public_key, message, signature) -> bool:
    A_hat, tr, t1 are decoded from public_key
    c_tilde, z, h are decoded from signature
    if h is not properly encoded, return False

    μ = keccak_prng(tr+m).extract(64)
    c = sample_in_ball_keccak_prng(c_tilde, τ)
    # computed in the NTT domain
    # two NTTs for c and z
    # one final inverse NTT.
    Az_minus_ct1 = A_hat * z - c * t1

    w_prime = h.use_hint(Az_minus_ct1, 2*γ_2)

    return check_norm_bound(z, γ_1 - β) and c_tilde == keccak_prng(μ + w_prime).extract(32)
```

### Required checks in ML-DSA(-ETH) verification

* The hint `h` needs to be properly encoded. The malformation of the hint is specified in Algorithm 21 of FIPS-204.
* The element `z` must have a norm satisfying `||z||_∞ < γ_1 - β`. The norm `||.||_∞` is defined page 6 of FIPS-204.
* The final hash output must be equal to the signature bytes `c_tilde`.

### Precompiled contract specification

### ML-DSA precompiled contract

The precompiled contract VERIFY_MLDSA is proposed with the following input and outputs, which are big-endian values:

* **Input data**
    * 32 bytes for the message
    * 2420 bytes for ML-DSA signature
    * 20512 bytes for the ML-DSA expanded public key
* **Output data**:
    * If the algorithm process succeeds, it returns 1 in 32 bytes format.
    * If the algorithm process fails, it returns 0 in 32 bytes format.

#### Error Cases

* Insufficient gas has been provided.
* Invalid input length (not compliant to described input)
* Invalid field element encoding (≥ q)
* Invalid norm  bound
* Invalid hint check
* Signature verification failure

### ML-DSA-ETH precompiled contract

The precompiled contract VERIFY_MLDSA_ETH is proposed with the following input and outputs, which are big-endian values:

* **Input data**
    * 32 bytes for the message
    * 2420 bytes for ML-DSA-ETH signature
    * 20512 bytes for the ML-DSA-ETH expanded public key
* **Output data**:
    * If the algorithm process succeeds, it returns 1 in 32 bytes format.
    * If the algorithm process fails, it returns 0 in 32 bytes format.

#### Error Cases

* Insufficient gas has been provided.
* Invalid input length (not compliant to described input)
* Invalid field element encoding (≥ q)
* Invalid norm  bound
* Invalid hint check
* Signature verification failure

### Precompiled contract gas usage

The cost of the **VERIFY_MLDSA** and **VERIFY_MLDSA_ETH** functions is dominated by the call to the NTTs, and the required hash calls for sampling in the ball (and for μ and the final check).
It represents in average 5 calls to the hash function. Taking linearly the cost of keccak256, and avoiding the context switching it represents 4500 gas.

### Compliance with EIP-7932

In compliance with [EIP-7932](./eip-7932.md),  the necessary parameters and structure for its integration are provided. `ALG_TYPE = 0xD1`  uniquely identifies ML-DSA transactions, set MAX_SIZE = 2420 bytes to accommodate the fixed-length signature_info container, and recommend a `GAS_PENALTY` of approximately `3000` gas subject to benchmarking. The verification function follows the EIP-7932 model, parsing the signature_info, recovering the corresponding Dilithium public key, verifying the signature against the transaction payload hash, and deriving the signer's Ethereum address as the last 20 bytes of keccak256(pubkey). This definition ensures that ML-DSA can be cleanly adopted within the `AlgorithmicTransaction` container specified by EIP-7932.

```python
signature_info = Container[
    # 0xD1 for ML-DSA (NIST-compliant version),
    # 0xD2 for ML-DSA-ETH (EVM-friendly version),
    version: uint8
    # ML-DSA signature
    signature: ByteVector[2420]
    # keccak256(pubkey)[12:]
    pubkey_hash: ByteVector[20]
]
```

In the format of EIP-7932:

* For the NIST-compliant version:

```python
verify(signature_info: bytes, payload_hash: Hash32) -> Bytes:
    assert len(signature_info) == 699
    version      = signature_info[0]
    signature    = signature_info[1:2421]
    pubkey_hash  = signature_info[2421:2441]
    assert version == 0xD1
    pubkey = lookup_pubkey(pubkey_hash)
    assert VERIFY_MLDSA(pubkey, payload_hash, signature)
    return pubkey
```

* For the EVM-friendly version:

```python
verify(signature_info: bytes, payload_hash: Hash32) -> Bytes:
    assert len(signature_info) == 699
    version      = signature_info[0]
    signature    = signature_info[1:2421]
    pubkey_hash  = signature_info[2421:2441]
    assert version == 0xD2
    pubkey = lookup_pubkey(pubkey_hash)
    assert VERIFY_MLDSA_ETH(pubkey, payload_hash, signature)
    return pubkey
```

## Rationale

The ML-DSA scheme was selected as a NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithm due to its strong security guarantees and efficiency.

ML-DSA is a signature algorithm build from lattice-based cryptography. Specifically, its hardness relies on the Short Integer Solution (SIS) problem and the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem, which is believed to be hard for both classical and quantum computers.

ML-DSA (based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium) offers a strong balance between security, efficiency, and practicality compared to classical ECC and other post-quantum schemes. Its signature and key sizes remain reasonably small, making it practical for real-world deployments such as Ethereum blockchain. As the main winner of the NIST PQC standardization process, it benefits from a broad community consensus on its security, which is not yet the case for many alternatives. Moreover, its lattice-based structure allows flexible parameter tuning, making it easier to adapt for specialized contexts like zero-knowledge proofs. Schemes like Falcon (FN-DSA, another signature scheme built on top of lattice-based assumptions) have a more rigid parameterization, making zero-knowledge circuits larger, and thus proof computation more expensive.

Given the increasing urgency of transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives or even having them ready in the event that research into quantum computers speeds up.
