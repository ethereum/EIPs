## Simple Summary
A **Non-Fungible Token** (NFT) standard used to vest tokens (EIP-20 or otherwise) over a vesting release curve. 

## Abstract
The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for NFT based contracts that hold and represent the vested and locked properties of any underlying token (EIP-20 or otherwise) that is emitted to the NFT holder. This standard is an extension of the EIP-721 token that provides basic functionality for creating vesting NFTs, claiming the tokens and reading vesting curve properties.

## Motivation
Vesting contracts, including timelock contracts, lack a standard and unified interface, which results in diverse implementations of such contracts. Standardizing such contracts into a single interface would allow for the creation of an ecosystem of on- and off-chain tooling around these contracts. In addition of this, liquid vesting in the form of non-fungible assets can prove to be a huge improvement over traditional **Simple Agreement for Future Tokens** (SAFTs) or **Externally Owned Account** (EOA)-based vesting as it enables transferability and the ability to attach metadata similar to the existing functionality offered by with traditional NFTs. 
  
Such a standard will not only provide a much-needed EIP-20 token lock standard, but will also enable the creation of secondary marketplaces tailored for semi-liquid SAFTs.  

This standard also allows for a variety of different vesting curves to be implement easily.  

These curves could represent: 
- linear vesting
- cliff vesting
- exponential vesting
- custom deterministic vesting

### Use Cases
1. A framework  to release tokens over a set period of time that can be used to build many kinds of NFT financial products such as bonds, treasury bills, and many others.
2. Replicating SAFT contracts in a standardized form of semi-liquid vesting NFT assets
    - SAFTs are generally off-chain, while today's on-chain versions are mainly address-based, which makes distributing vesting shares to many representatives difficult. Standardization simplifies this convoluted process.
3. Providing a path for the standardization of vesting and token timelock contracts
    - There are many such contracts in the wild and most of them differ in both interface and implementation.
4. NFT marketplaces dedicated to vesting NFTs
    - Whole new sets of interfaces and analytics could be created from a common standard for token vesting NFTs.
5. Integrating vesting NFTs into services like Gnosis Safe
    - A standard would mean services like Gnosis Safe could more easily and uniformly support interactions with these types of contracts inside of a multisig contract.
6. Enable standardized fundraising implementations and general fundraising that sell vesting tokens (eg. SAFTs) in a more transparent manner.
7. Allows tools, front-end apps, aggregators, etc. to show a more holistic view of the vesting tokens and the properties available to users.
    - Currently, every project needs to write their own visualization of the vesting schedule of their vesting assets. If this is standardized, third-party tools could be developed aggregate all vesting NFTs from all projects for the user, display their schedules and allow the user to take aggregated vesting actions.
    - Such tooling can easily discover compliance through the EIP-165 supportsInterface(IVestingNFT) check.
8. Makes it easier for a single wrapping implementation to be used across all vesting standards that defines multiple recipients, periodic renting of vesting tokens etc.


## Specification
<!-- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)). -->
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Rationale
<!-- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. -->
**vesting terms**
- _vesting_: Tokens which are locked until a future date
- _vested_: Tokens which have reached their unlock date. (The usage in this specification relates to the **total** vested tokens for a given Vesting NFT.)
- _claimable_: Amount of tokens which can be claimed at the current `timestamp`. 
- _timestamp_: The [unix](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) `timestamp` (seconds) representation of dates used for vesting. 

**vesting functions**
- `vestingPayout()` and `vestedPayout()` add up to the total number of tokens which can be claimed by the end of of the vesting schedule, which is also equal to `vestedPayoutAtTime()` with `type(uint256).max` as the `timestamp`.
- `vestedPayout()` will provide the total amount of tokens which are eligible for release (including claimed tokens), while `claimablePayout()` provides the amount of tokens which can be claimed at the current `timestamp`.
- `vestedPayoutAtTime()` provides functionality to iterate through the `vestingPeriod()` and provide a visual of the release curve. This allows for tools to iterate through a vesting schedule and create a visualization using on-chain data. It would be incredible to see integrations such as [hot-chain-svg](https://github.com/w1nt3r-eth/hot-chain-svg) to be able to create SVG visuals of vesting curves directly on-chain. 



**timestamps**
Generally in Solidity development it is advised against using `block.timestamp` as a state dependant variable as the timestamp of a block can be manipulated by a miner. The choice to use a `timestamp` over a `block` is to allow the interface to work across multiple **Ethereum Virtual Machine** (EVM) compatible networks which generally have different block times. Block proposal with a significantly fabricated timestamp will generally be dropped by all node implementations which makes the window for abuse negligible.

The `timestamp` makes cross chain integration easy, but internally, the reference implementation keeps track of the token payout per Vesting NFT to ensure that excess tokens alloted by the vesting terms cannot be claimed. 


## Backwards Compatibility
<!-- All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright. -->
- The Vesting NFT standard is meant to be fully backwards compatible with any current [EIP-721 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) integrations and marketplaces.
- The Vesting NFT standard also supports [EIP-165 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) interface detection for detecting `EIP-721` compatibility, as well as Vesting NFT compatibility.

## Reference Implementation
<!-- An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.  If the implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. -->
<!-- TODO: Add proper link to url when -->
A reference implementation of this EIP can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/ApeSwapFinance/eip-5725-vesting-nft-implementation).


## Test Cases
The reference vesting NFT repository includes tests written in Hardhat.


## Security Considerations
<!-- All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers. -->
**timestamps**
- Vesting schedules are based on timestamps. As such, it's important to keep track of the number of tokens which have been claimed and to not give out more tokens than alloted for a specific Vesting NFT. 
  - `vestedPayoutAtTime(tokenId, type(uint256).max)`, for example, must return the total payout for a given `tokenId`

**approvals**
- When an approval is made on a Vesting NFT, the operator would have the rights to transfer the Vesting NFT to themselves and then claim the vested tokens.
