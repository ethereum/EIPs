## Abstract

This EIP reserves a [transaction-type](./eip-2718.md) range for use by the Rollup Improvement Proposal (RIP) process to ensure there are no conflicts.

## Motivation

For L2s to use new transactrion types, it is necessary to reserve an transaction-type range for use by the RIP process so as to ensure there are no conflicts between transaction types used by RIPs and EIPs.

## Specification

The transaction-type (as specified in [EIP-2718](./eip-2718)) range from `0x40` to `0x7f` (inclusive of both) is reserved for use by the RIP process.

## Rationale

By reserving a transaction-type range for RIPs, it allows the RIP process to maintain its own registry of transaction types that are not (necessarily) in use on L1 mainnet, the EIP process is then freed from having to maintain a registry of RIP tx-types while still having 64 tx-types for its own use.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues found.
