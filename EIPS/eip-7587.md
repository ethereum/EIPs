## Abstract

This EIP reserves precompile ranges to ensure there are no conflicts with those used by the Rollup Improvement Proposal (RIP) process.

## Motivation

As L2s begin to deploy RIPs, it is necessary to reserve an address range for use by the RIP process so as to ensure there are no conflicts between precompile addresses used by RIPs and EIPs.

## Specification

The address range between `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000100` and `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000001ff` is reserved for use by the RIP process.

## Rationale

By reserving an address range for RIPs, it allows the RIP process to maintain its own registry of precompiles that are not (necessarily) deployed on L1 mainnet, the EIP process is freed from having to maintain a registry of RIP precompiles while still having 255 addresses for its own use.
