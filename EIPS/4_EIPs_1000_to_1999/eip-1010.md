## Simple Summary

This document proposes to improve the uniformity of ether distribution
between wallet address `0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B` and
wallet address `0x15E55EF43efA8348dDaeAa455F16C43B64917e3c` which are
currently experiencing a significant non-uniformity.

## Abstract

As of the date of this EIP, the difference in balance between
address `0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B` and address
`0x15E55EF43efA8348dDaeAa455F16C43B64917e3c` is far from equitable
or uniform, with the former having more than 365,000 ether
more than the latter. The distribution of ether between these two
addresses must be improved in order to protect the Ethereum economy
from centralized control. This will be accomplished by transferring
100,000 ether from the former address to the latter. This is a properly
motivated improvement in keeping with the core Ethereum philosophy of
decentralization.

## Motivation

This proposal is necessary because the Ethereum protocol does not allow
the owner of an address which does not own an equitable amount of ether
to claim their share of ether from an address which owns a dangerously
centralized quantity. Rather than proposing an overly complicated generic
mechanism for any user to claim ether to which they believe they are
equitably entitled, this proposal will take the simple route of a one-time
transfer of 100,000 ether from `0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B`
to `0x15E55EF43efA8348dDaeAa455F16C43B64917e3c`. This avoids duplicating
the effort of other proposals and provides a net improvement to the
Ethereum project and community.

## Specification

The balance of `0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B` will be decreased
by 100,000 ether. The balance of `0x15E55EF43efA8348dDaeAa455F16C43B64917e3c`
will be increased by 100,000 ether. No net change in the amount of extant
ether will occur unless at the time of implementation the former address does not
contain sufficient ether for such a deduction.

## Rationale

The value 100,000 was chosen after careful technically sound analysis of various economic theories
developed over the past century. In spite of the fact that it is a convenient round
number, it is actually the exact output of a complex statistical process iterated to
determine the optimal distribution of ether between these addresses.

## Backwards Compatibility

Clients that fail to implement this change will not be aware of the correct balances
for these addresses. This will create a hard fork. The implementation of this change
consistently among all clients as intended by the proposal process will be sufficient
to ensure that backwards compatibility is not a concern.
