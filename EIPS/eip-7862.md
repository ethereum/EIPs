## Abstract

This EIP proposes that, for each block `n`, the `state_root` in block `n`'s `ExecutionPayload` references the **post-state of block `n-1`**. As a result, block `n` no longer needs to include or verify the newly computed state root for block `n`’s own transactions. This removes the expensive state root computation from the block-propagation critical path, reducing end-to-end latency for block production and potentially increasing throughput.

## Motivation

Currently, every Ethereum block includes two `state_root`. 

The consensus layer (CL) `state_root` contained within the `BeaconBlock` tracks CL state (e.g., validator entries and exits).

The execution layer (EL) `state_root` contained within the `ExecutionPayload` tracks the effect of transaction execution (e.g., account balances, code, etc.). 

The EL `state_root` must be computed by block builders (and verified by relays, validators, and light clients) in near-real-time. This computation accounts for a large fraction of block production and verification time, especially in an MEV-Boost environment. This overhead is also a challenge for efforts to enable real-time ZK proving of the chain.

By delaying the EL `state_root` reference by one block, we can remove EL `state_root` calculation overhead from the critical path of block production. Instead, clients can pipeline calculation of block `n-1`'s EL `state_root` during the idle slot time of block `n`.

This change will lower latency at the tip, allowing us to increase throughput and simplify the block production pipeline. It can also significantly accelerate the timeline of real-time ZK proving Ethereum.

## Specification

### Execution Layer Changes

1. **`ExecutionPayload` State Root Field**
   
   - **Before** (in the current post-Merge design):
   
     ```solidity
     struct ExecutionPayload {
       uint256 blockNumber;
       uint256 timestamp;
       bytes32 parentHash;
       address feeRecipient;
       bytes32 stateRoot;  // references the post-state root of *this* block's transactions
     }
     ```
   
   - **After** (conceptual):
   
     ```solidity
     struct ExecutionPayload {
       uint256 blockNumber;
       uint256 timestamp;
       bytes32 parentHash;
       address feeRecipient;
       bytes32 stateRoot;  // now references *this* block's pre-state i.e. the post-state root of block (n-1)
     }
     ```
     
   - In other words, block `n`’s `ExecutionPayload.stateRoot` must now point to the **execution-layer post-state of block `n-1`**, rather than referencing the new state after block `n`’s own transactions.

3. **Block Header Validation**
   
   - **Remove** the rule requiring each block’s `stateRoot` to match the **post-state** produced by the transactions in *that same block*:  
   - **Instead**, require that `payload_n.stateRoot == post_state(n-1)`:
     
     ```python
     def validate_execution_payload(payload_n, post_state_of_block_n_minus_1):
         # Was:
         #   assert compute_state_root(transactions_of_block_n) == payload_n.stateRoot
         #
         # Now:
         assert payload_n.stateRoot == post_state_of_block_n_minus_1
     ```
     
   - The actual new state root resulting from block `n` will only appear in block `n+1`.

4. **Proactive Computation of Post-state Root**:
   
   - To fully realize latency benefits, clients should compute the post-state root of block `n-1` during the idle time of slot `n`.  
     - Concretely, once block `n-1` is received and processed, the client can generate (or finalize) its EL post-state root in the “gap” while waiting for block `n` to arrive.  
     - By doing so, when block `n` arrives, the node can quickly verify that `payload_n.stateRoot` matches the already-known `post_state(n-1)`.  
   - Alternatively, a client could lazily wait until block `n` arrives to compute the post-state root for `n-1`, but this would negate much of the latency advantage. The client would again have to pause to compute the previous root before finalizing the current block’s verification.  

### Consensus Layer

No changes are required in the CL validation process or block structure:

- The beacon block continues to wrap each ExecutionPayload as usual.
- The proposal only changes how the EL stateRoot field is populated and validated.
  
### Transition / Fork Activation

Upon the hard fork that activates this proposal (call this activation block `F`):

- **Block `F`** will **repeat** the same EL `state_root` as the preceding block `F-1`. That is:

```solidity
  ExecutionPayload(F).stateRoot = post_state(F-1)
```

- **Block `F+1`** will reference the post-state of block `F`, continuing the new delayed root scheme from that point onward.

## Rationale

1. **Reduce Latency at the Tip**
   
   - Proposers and builders no longer must compute and finalize the new state root within the same slot.  
   - This speeds up block validation, as validators can sign after checking the execution of the block and that its pre-state root matches their pre-computed expectation (i.e., without needing to wait to calculate a new state root).

3. **Increase Throughput**
   
   - The time currently spent on same-slot `state_root` computation can be repurposed.  
   - This time may now be reallocated to increased L1 block capacity (higher gas targets) or quicker slot times with less risk of reorgs.

5. **Simplify Timing for MEV-Boost and Builders**
   
   - In a proposer-builder separation (PBS) model, block construction speed is an important competitive dimension for builders and relays. 
   - Delaying the state root also helps participants in the block production pipeline. Builders can reallocate the time to building more efficient blocks, and relays do not have to worry about state root delay as a source of timing variance or competition.

7. **Accelerate Real-time ZK Proving**
   
   - Merkle roots are particularly challenging for ZK proving systems, because Keccak is not a ZK-friendly hash function. 
   - Without a delayed state root, real-time SNARK proofs would share all of the latency issues with the existing real-time state root (but many times worse, as they take longer to calculate).
       - Block proposers and builders would need to be able to prove the state root in <1s after deciding on their built blocks. This is not realistically possible. 
       - The latency would interact with the MEV pipeline in the same way that the current state root calculation latency does.
   - With a delayed state root, the calculation of an accompanying ZK proof can also be delayed (pipelined). The network will instead have ~6 seconds to generate the proof, which is much more feasible. 
   - State root delay is likely a **necessary** change for real-time ZK proving.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is a consensus-breaking change and requires a coordinated hard fork on mainnet or any network that adopts it. Once activated, older clients that expect blocks to contain their own (execution layer) post-state root will be incompatible and fail to sync.

## Security Considerations

1. **Light clients**
   
   - Must accept that a block’s final state root is not published until the subsequent block, adding up to a slot’s worth of latency (e.g. 12 seconds).  
   - In practice, many light client protocols already tolerate slight delays in proof availability.
   - Notably, many other blockchain networks already operate on a delayed state root and it has worked fine. One such network, Cosmos, is a multichain architecture based entirely on light-client interoperability with a delayed state root.

3. **Reliant Contracts**

   - We are not aware of any common contract types that assume the availability of same-block state roots.
