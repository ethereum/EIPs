## Abstract

This EIP allows for tail call optimizations in EOF functions ([EIP-4750](./eip-4750.md)) by introducing a new instruction `JUMPF`, which jumps to a code section without adding a new return stack frame.

Additionally the format of the type sections is extended to allow declaring sections as non-returning, with simplified stack validation for `JUMPF` to such section.

## Motivation

It is common for functions to make a call at the end of the routine only to then return. `JUMPF` optimizes this behavior by changing code sections without needing to update the return stack.

Knowing at validation time that a function will never return control allows for `JUMPF` to such function to be treated similar to terminating instructions, where extra items may be left on the operand stack at execution termination. This provides opportunities for compilers to generate more optimal code, both in code size and in spent gas. It is particularly beneficial for small error handling helpers, that end execution with `REVERT`: they are commonly reused in multiple branches and extracting them into a helper function is efficient, when there is no need to pop extra stack items before `JUMPF` to such helper.

## Specification

### Type section changes

We define a non-returning section as one that cannot return control to its caller section.

Type section `outputs` field contains a special value `0x80` when corresponding code section is non-returning. See [Non-returning status validation](#non-returning-status-validation) below for validation details.

The first code section MUST have 0 inputs and be non-returning.

### Execution Semantics

A new instruction, `JUMPF (0xe5)`, is introduced.

1. `JUMPF` has one immediate argument, `target_section_index`, encoded as a 16-bit unsigned big-endian value.
2. If the operand stack size exceeds `1024 - type[target_section_index].max_stack_height + type[target_section_index].inputs` (i.e. if the called function may exceed the global stack height limit), execution results in an exceptional halt. This guarantees that the target function does not exceed global stack height limit.
3. `JUMPF` sets `current_section_index` to `target_section_index` and `PC` to `0`, but does not change the return stack. Execution continues in the target section. 
4. `JUMPF` costs 5 gas.
5. `JUMPF` neither pops nor pushes anything to the operand stack.

### Code Validation

Let the definition of `type[i]` be inherited from [EIP-4750](./eip-4750.md) and define `stack_height_min` and `stack_height_max` to be the stack height bounds at a certain instruction during the instruction flow traversal.

* The immediate argument of `JUMPF` MUST be less than the total number of code sections.
* For each `JUMPF` instruction:
  * either `type[current_section_index].outputs` MUST be greater or equal `type[target_section_index].outputs`,
  * or `type[target_section_index].outputs` MUST be `0x80`
* The stack height validation at `JUMPF` depends on whether the target section is non-returning:
  * `JUMPF` into returning section (`type[target_section_index].outputs` does not equal `0x80`):  `stack_height_min` and `stack_height_max` MUST be equal to `type[current_section_index].outputs - type[target_section_index].outputs + type[target_section_index].inputs`. This means that target section can output less stack elements than the original code section called by the top element on the return stack, if the current code section leaves the delta `type[current_section_index].outputs - type[target_section_index].outputs` element(s) on the stack.
  * `JUMPF` into non-returning section (`type[target_section_index].outputs` equals `0x80`): `stack_height_min` MUST be greater than or equal to `type[target_section_index].inputs`.
* Stack overflow check at `JUMPF`: `stack_height_max` MUST be less than or equal to `1024 - types[target_section_index].max_stack_height + types[target_section_index].inputs`.
* `JUMPF` is considered terminating instruction, i.e. does not have successor instructions in code validation and MAY be final instruction in the section. 
* The code validation defined in [EIP-4200](./eip-4200.md) also fails if any `RJUMP*` offset points to one of the two bytes directly following a `JUMPF` instruction.

`CALLF` instruction validation is extended to include the rule:

* Code section is invalid in case an immediate argument `target_section_index` of any `CALLF` targets a non-returning section, i.e. `type[target_section_index].outputs` equals `0x80`.

#### Non-returning status validation

Section type MUST be non-returning if and only if the section contains no `RETF` instructions and no `JUMPF` instructions targeting returning sections (target section's status is checked via its output value in type section.)
*Note: This implies that section containing only `JUMPF`s into non-returning sections is non-returning itself.*

## Rationale

### Allowing `JUMPF` to section with less outputs

An alternative rule for `JUMPF` stack validation could require the target section's outputs to be exactly equal to the current section's outputs. Under such rule, a particular target section (a shared "helper" piece of code) would only "match" sections (requiring some shared "helper" code to execute before returning) *with the same number of outputs*.

Instead, we allow a given `JUMPF` target section to be called from sections with more outputs, as long as these sections provide these extra stack elements (the "delta") themselves. This will reduce duplicated code as it will allow compilers more flexibility during code generation such that certain helpers can be used generically by functions, regardless of their output values.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change is backward compatible as EOF does not allow undefined instructions to be used or deployed, meaning no contracts will be affected.

## Security Considerations

Needs discussion.
