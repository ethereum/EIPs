## Abstract

This EIP modifies the 'eth' p2p protocol to announce the historical block range served by
the node. We also simplify the handshake to remove total difficulty information, which
isn't used anymore after the merge. Additionally we propose to remove the `Bloom` field
from receipts transfered over the protocol.

## Motivation

### Removing Bloom in Receipts

We recently discovered that none of the clients store the `Bloom` field of the receipts as
it can be recomputed on demand. However the networking spec requires the `Bloom` field to
be sent over the network. Thus a syncing node will ask for the Bloom filters for all
receipts. The serving node will regenerate roughly 530GB of bloom filters (2.3B txs * 256
byte). These 530GBs are send over the network to the syncing peer, the syncing peer will
verify them and not store them either. This adds an additional 530GB of unnecessary
bandwidth to every sync.

### earliestBlock in Status message

In the history expiry working group, it was decided that clients may drop pre-merge
history from their storage after April 1, 2025. For clients that want to sync history
through the 'eth' protocol, it is essential to know whether a peer still serves old
history. A similar idea was proposed in
[EIP-7542](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7542) but was later withdrawn because a
political decision on history expiry had not been reached at the time.

## Specification

Modify the `Status (0x00)` message as follows:

- (eth/68): `[version: P, networkid: P, td: P, blockhash: B_32, genesis: B_32, forkid]`

- (eth/69): `[version: P, networkid: P, blockhash: B_32, genesis: B_32, forkid, earliestBlock: P]`

Modify the encoding for receipts in the `Receipts (0x10)` message as follows:

- (eth/68): `receipt = {legacy-receipt, typed-receipt}` with

```
typed-receipt = tx-type || legacy-receipt

legacy-receipt = [
    post-state-or-status: {B_32, {0, 1}},
    cumulative-gas: P,
    bloom: B_256,
    logs: [log₁, log₂, ...]
]
```

- (eth/69): `receipt = [tx-type, post-state-or-status, cumulative-gas, logs]`

## Rationale

After the merge, the `TD` field of the `Status` message became meaningless since the
difficulty of post-merge blocks are 0. It could in theory be used to distinguish synced
with unsynced nodes, but the same thing can be accomplished with the forkid as well.

Removing the bloom filters from the `Receipt` message reduces the CPU load of serving
nodes as well as the bandwidth significantly. The receiving nodes will need to recompute
the bloom filter in order to fully verify the receipt hash. The recomputation is not very
CPU intensive. The bandwidth gains amount to roughly 530GiB per syncing node or (at least)
95GiB snappy compressed.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP changes the eth protocol and requires rolling out a new version, `eth/69`.
Supporting multiple versions of a wire protocol is possible. Rolling out a new version
does not break older clients immediately, since they can keep using protocol version
`eth/68`.

This EIP does not change consensus rules of the EVM and does not require a hard fork.
