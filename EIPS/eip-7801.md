## Abstract

This EIP introduces a method enabling an Ethereum node to communicate its available block spans via a bitmask, where each bit represents a 100_000-block span within each 1_000_000 block range of chain history. Nodes use this bitmask to signal which spans of historical data they store and commit to storing future spans as they are created. This enables peers to make informed decisions about data availability without first connecting and querying for availability. The bitmask repeats every 1 million blocks, making for a somewhat simple to reason about probability of data availability.

The proposal extends the Ethereum wire protocol (`eth`) with version `eth/70`, introducing a `blockBitmask` field in the handshake.

## Motivation

With [EIP-4444](./eip-4444.md), nodes may begin pruning historical data while others continue to serve it. The current approach of connecting and requesting specific blocks to determine data availability is inefficient, consuming unnecessary bandwidth. This EIP addresses this by sharding chain history into 100_000 block segments, and allows nodes to signal which shards they store via a bitmask.

By using a bitmask in place of a range, nodes provide a snapshot of data locality and future storage commitments, supporting efficient data requests.

## Specification

- Advertise a new `eth` protocol capability (version) at `eth/70`.
  - The existing `eth/69` protocol will continue alongside `eth/70` until sufficient adoption.
- Modify the `Status (0x00)` message for `eth/70` to add a `blockBitmask` field after the `forkid`:
  - Current packet for `eth/69`: `[version: P, networkid: P, blockhash: B_32, genesis: B_32, forkid]`
  - New packet for `eth/70`: `[version: P, networkid: P, blockhash: B_32, genesis: B_32, forkid, blockBitmask]`,
  where `blockBitmask` is a 10-bit bitmask, with each bit representing a 100_000-block range per 1_000_000 blocks of history.  

- Define node behavior based on the bitmask as follows:
  - **Bitmask Initialization**: Upon startup, nodes **MAY** set at least one bit in the `blockBitmask` to `on` and backfill that 100_000-block span to ensure data availability for that shard.
  - **Shard Retention Probability**: Nodes **SHOULD** retain new block spans according to their bitmask, with participating nodes providing at least 10% of the chain history.
  - **Additional Shard Retention Buffer**: Retained shard ranges should also include 1_000 blocks prior to and after the shard boundary.  This will prevent edge effects where a typical range request size of 200 blocks which crosses a 100k shard boundary cannot be satisfied by any single node.
  - **Commitment to Future Ranges**: Participating nodes **MUST** retain 100_000 block spans which correspond to their advertised bitmask as blocks are added to the chain
  - **Bitmask Space**: The 100_000 range `blockBitmask` repeats every 1 million blocks, enabling efficient representation of historical data locality across epochs.

Upon connecting using `eth/70`, nodes exchange the `Status` message, including the `blockBitmask`. This single handshake message, which includes the bitmask, eliminates the need for additional message types.

Nodes should maintain connections regardless of a peerâ€™s bitmask state, except when peer slots are full. In this case, nodes may prioritize connections with peers that serve more relevant shards.

If a node is interested in querying a specific block span, it can use the bitmask to determine which peers are more likely to have the data. If the peer they are connected to does not have the data, they can disconnect and connect to another peer, until they find what they have been looking for.

### ENR variation

This EIP could be implemented without a new protocol version by adding a new field to the Ethereum Node Record (ENR) to advertise the bitmask. This would allow nodes to advertise their available block spans without requiring a handshake. However, this approach would not provide the same level of assurance as the handshake, as the ENR is not authenticated. Also, it would make the discovery process much simpler, as nodes would only need to check the ENR to determine if a peer has the data they need.

## Rationale

The bitmask approach provides a flexible means to represent and retain block data while committing to future spans. This mechanism aligns with the pruning proposed in EIP-4444, while ensuring that historical and future data spans remain available across the network.

A similar bitlist approach is already used in the Consensus Layer for attestation subnets, making it a familiar and efficient method for representing data spans. Additionally, committing to future spans ensures better predictability and stability for data locality.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP introduces `eth/70`, extending the handshake in a backward-incompatible manner. However, `devp2p` allows concurrent versions of the same protocol, so nodes can continue using older protocol versions (e.g., `eth/69`, `eth/68`, `eth/67`) if they lack support for `eth/70`.

This EIP does not affect the consensus engine or require a hard fork.

## Security Considerations

There are some considerations:

- Data unavailability for any given shard can be modeled as: P = (0.9)^n, where n is the number of peers.  Assuming a random distribution of nodes that are participating in EIP-7801 history sharding, for 25 peers, this chance is 7%.  For 32 peers, this chance drops to 3.4%. This assumes that a significant number of nodes on the network are serving at least one shard.  Adoption by a majority of clients as a default would likely be necessary for a complete sharded history to be available and replicated sufficiently across the network.
- As history grows, so will the size of the retained shards on disk, thus raising the storage requirements per node.  However, nodes will still benefit from a ~90% storage reduction over the present chain storage requirements, and will scale their future chain storage requirements by only 10% of the rate they would have by retaining all history.
