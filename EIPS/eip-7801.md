## Abstract

This EIP proposes the creation of a new subprotocol, `etha`, enabling Ethereum nodes to communicate available block spans via a bitmask. Each bit represents a 100_000-block span within each 1_000_000 block range of chain history. Nodes use this bitmask to signal stored spans and commit to storing future spans as they are created. This allows peers to make informed decisions about data availability without first connecting and querying for it. The bitmask repeats every 1 million blocks for straightforward reasoning about data availability probabilities.

The `etha` subprotocol has the same functionality to serve historical data using message types copied from the `eth` protocol, enabling efficient data retrieval.

## Motivation

With [EIP-4444](./eip-4444.md), nodes may prune historical data while others continue serving it. Determining data availability by connecting and requesting blocks is inefficient consuming unnexessary bandwidth. This EIP addresses this inefficiency by enabling nodes to shard chain history into 100_000 block segments and signal availability via a bitmask.

By introducing a separate subprotocol, `etha`, nodes can exchange this information seamlessly and retain the ability to serve historical data without impacting existing `eth` protocol versions.

## Specification

### Subprotocol Handshake

- Introduce a new subprotocol named `etha`.
- Define the handshake message for the `etha` subprotocol as follows:
  - Handshake packet: `[version: P, networkid: P, blockhash: B_32, genesis: B_32, forkid, blockBitmask]`
  - `blockBitmask` is a 10-bit bitmask, with each bit representing a 100_000-block range per 1_000_000 blocks of history.
  - the rest of the elements are as defined in eth/69

### Supported Messages

The `etha` subprotocol **MUST** include support for the following messages from the `eth/69` protocol to facilitate historical data serving:

- **GetBlockBodies (0x05):** Request block bodies.
- **BlockBodies (0x06):** Response to `GetBlockBodies`.
- **GetReceipts (0x0f):** Request receipts.
- **Receipts (0x10):** Response to `GetReceipts`.

The semantics and payload structures for these messages are identical to their counterparts in the `eth/69` protocol, ensuring compatibility for historical data serving.

### Node Behavior

- **Bitmask Initialization**: Nodes **MAY** set at least one bit in the `blockBitmask` to `on` upon startup and backfill the corresponding 100_000-block span.
- **Shard Retention Probability**: Nodes **MUST** retain new block spans according to their bitmask, aiming to cover at least 10% of chain history.
- **Additional Shard Retention Buffer**: Nodes **SHOULD** retain 1_000 blocks before and after shard boundaries to accommodate edge cases.
- **Commitment to Future Ranges**: Nodes **MUST** retain spans corresponding to their advertised bitmask as new blocks are added.
- **Bitmask Space**: The 100_000 range `blockBitmask` repeats every 1 million blocks, enabling efficient representation of historical data locality across epochs.

Upon connection using `etha`, nodes exchange the handshake message with the `blockBitmask`. This single handshake eliminates the need for additional message types.

### ENR Extension

Alternatively, the `blockBitmask` could be derived or encoded into the Ethereum Node Record (ENR), enabling nodes to advertise block spans without a handshake. As an example, the `blockBitmask` can be derived from the `secp256k1` field of the ENR.  However, this method lacks the authentication and reliability of the handshake approach. Additionally, there is not guarantee that the node you are connecting to supports the `etha` subprotocol.

## Rationale

The bitmask approach provides a flexible means to represent and retain block data while committing to future spans. This mechanism aligns with the pruning proposed in EIP-4444, while ensuring that historical and future data spans remain available across the network.

A similar bitlist approach is already used in the Consensus Layer for attestation subnets, making it a familiar and efficient method for representing data spans. Additionally, committing to future spans ensures better predictability and stability for data locality.

The `etha` subprotocol separates this functionality from `eth` ensuring nodes dont hammer other nodes with requests on historical ranges that they do not posses on the eth protocol.

## Backwards Compatibility

The `etha` subprotocol is independent of the `eth` protocol.

This EIP does not affect the consensus engine or require a hard fork.

## Security Considerations

There are some considerations:

- Data unavailability for any given shard can be modeled as: P = (0.9)^n, where n is the number of peers.  Assuming a random distribution of nodes that are participating in EIP-7801 history sharding, for 25 peers, this chance is 7%.  For 32 peers, this chance drops to 3.4%. This assumes that a significant number of nodes on the network are serving at least one shard.  Adoption by a majority of clients as a default would likely be necessary for a complete sharded history to be available and replicated sufficiently across the network.
- As history grows, so will the size of the retained shards on disk, thus raising the storage requirements per node.  However, nodes will still benefit from a ~90% storage reduction over the present chain storage requirements, and will scale their future chain storage requirements by only 10% of the rate they would have by retaining all history.
