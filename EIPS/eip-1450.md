# ERC-1450 - A compatible security token for issuing and trading SEC-compliant securities

## Simple Summary
`ERC-1450` is an `ERC-20` compatible token that enables issuing tokens representing securities that are required to comply with one or more of the following [Securities Act Regulations: Regulation Crowdfunding, Regulation D, and Regulation A](https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings).

## Abstract
`ERC-1450` facilitates the recording of ownership and transfer of securities sold in compliance with the [Securities Act Regulations CF, D and A](https://www.sec.gov/smallbusiness/exemptofferings). The issuance and trading of securities is subject to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and specific U.S. state blue sky laws and regulations.

`ERC-1450` manages securities ownership during issuance and trading. The Issuer is the only role that should create a `ERC-1450` and assign the RTA. The RTA is the only role that is allowed to execute `ERC-1450`’s `mint`, `burnFrom`, and `transferFrom` functions. No role is allowed to execute `ERC-1450`’s `transfer` function.

## Motivation
With the advent of the [JOBS Act](https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/jobs-act.shtml) in 2012 and the launch of Regulation Crowdfunding and the amendments to Regulation A and Regulation D in 2016, there has been an expansion in the exemptions available to Issuers and Investors to sell and purchase securities that have not been "registered" with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933.

There are currently no token standards that expressly facilitate conformity to securities law and related regulations. ERC-20 tokens do not support the regulated roles of Funding Portal, Broker Dealer, RTA, and Investor and do not support the [Bank Secrecy Act/USA Patriot Act KYC and AML requirements](https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/compliance-bsa/bsa/index-bsa.html). Other improvements (notably [EIP-1404 (Simple Restricted Token Standard)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1404) have tried to tackle KYC and AML regulatory requirement. This approach is novel because the RTA is solely responsible for performing KYC and AML and should be solely responsible for `transferFrom`, `mint`, and `burnFrom`.

## Specification
`ERC-1450` extends `ERC-20`.

### `ERC-1450`
`ERC-1450` requires that only the Issuer can create a token representing the security that only the RTA manages. Instantiating the `ERC-1450` requires the `Owned` and `IssuerControlled` modifiers, and only the Issuer should execute the `ERC-1450` constructor for a compliant token. `ERC-1450` extends the general `Ownable` modifier to describe a specific subset of owners that automate and decentralize compliance through the contract modifiers `Owned` and `IssuerControlled` and the function modifiers `onlyOwner` and `onlyIssuerTransferAgent`. The `Owned` contract modifier instantiates the `onlyOwner` modifier for functions. The `IssuerControlled` modifier instantiates the `onlyIssuerTransferAgent` modifier for functions.

`ERC-1450` must prevent anyone from executing the `transfer`, `allowance`, and `approve` functions and/or implement these functions to always fail. `ERC-1450` updates the `transferFrom`, `mint`, and `burnFrom` functions. `transferFrom`, `mint`, and `burnFrom` may only be executed by the RTA and are restricted with the `onlyIssuerTransferAgent` modifier. Additionally, `ERC-1450` defines the functions `transferOwnership`, `setTransferAgent`, `setPhysicalAddressOfOperation`, and `isTransferAgent`.  Only the issuer may call the `transferOwnership`, `setTransferAgent`, and `setPhysicalAddressOfOperation` functions. Anyone may call the `isTransferAgent` function.

### Issuers and RTAs
For compliance reasons, the `ERC-1450` constructor must specify the issuer (the `owner`), the RTA (`transferAgent`), the security’s `name`, and the security’s `symbol`.

#### Issuer Owned
`ERC-1450` must specify the `owner` in its constructor, apply the `Owned` modifier, and instantiate the `onlyOwner` modifier to enable specific functions to permit only the Issuer’s `owner` address to execute them. `ERC-1450` also defines the function `transferOwnership` which transfers ownership of the Issuer to the new `owner`’s address and can only be called by the `owner`. `transferOwnership` triggers the `OwnershipTransferred` event.

#### Issuer Controlled
`IssuerControlled` maintains the Issuer’s ownership of their securities by owning the contract and enables the Issuer to set and update the RTA for the Issuer’s securities. `ERC-1450`‘s constructor must have an `IssuerControlled` modifier with the issuer specified in its `ERC-1450` constructor. `IssuerControlled` instantiates the `onlyIssuerTransferAgent` modifier for `ERC-1450` to enable specific functions (`setPhysicalAddressOfOperation` and `setTransferAgent`) to permit only the Issuer to execute these functions.

#### Register Transfer Agent Controlled
`ERC-1450` defines the `setTransferAgent` function (to change the RTA) and `setPhysicalAddressOfOperation` function (to change the Issuer’s address) and must restrict execution to the Issuer’s owner with the `onlyOwner` modifier. `setTransferAgent` must emit the `TransferAgentUpdated` event. `setPhysicalAddressOfOperation` must emit the `PhysicalAddressOfOperationUpdated` event.

`ERC-1450` must specify the `transferAgent` in its constructor and instantiate the `onlyIssuerTransferAgent` modifier to enable specific functions (`transferFrom`, `mint`, and `burnFrom`) to permit only the Issuer’s `transferAgent` address to execute them. `ERC-1450` also defines the public function `isTransferAgent` to lookup and identify the Issuer’s RTA.

#### Securities
`ERC-1450` updates the `transferFrom`, `mint`, and `burnFrom` functions by applying the `onlyIssuerTransferAgent` to enable the issuance, re-issuance, and trading of securities.

### ERC-20 Extension
`ERC-20` tokens provide the following functionality:

```solidity
contract ERC20 {
  function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256);
  function balanceOf(address who) public view returns (uint256);
  function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool);
  function allowance(address owner, address spender) public view returns (uint256);
  function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) public returns (bool);
  function approve(address spender, uint256 value) public returns (bool);
  event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
  event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
}
```

`ERC-20` is extended as follows:

```solidity

 * 
 * Approval - Should never be called as the functions that emit this event must be
 *     implemented to always fail. 
 * 
 * Implementations of the ERC-1450 standard must implement the following required
 *     ERC-20 functions to always fail:
 *

 * 
 * mint - Only the address of the issuer's Registered Transfer Agent may create new
 *     securities.
 * burnFrom - Only the address of the issuer’s Registered Transfer Agent may burn or

### Securities Exchange Commission Requirements
The SEC has very strict requirements as to the specific roles that are allowed to perform specific actions. Specifically, only the RTA may `mint` and `transferFrom` securities.

Implementers must maintain off-chain services and databases that record and track the Investor’s name, physical address, Ethereum address, and security ownership amount. The implementers and the SEC must be able to access the Investor’s private information on an as needed basis. Issuers and the RTA must be able to produce a current list of all Investors, including the names, addresses, and security ownership levels for every security at any given moment. Issuers and the RTA must be able to re-issue securities to Investors for a variety of regulated reasons.

Private Investor information must never be publicly exposed on a public blockchain. 

### Managing Investor Information
Special care and attention must be taken to ensure that the personally identifiable information of Investors is never exposed or revealed to the public.

### Issuers who lost access to their address or private keys
There is no recourse if the Issuer loses access to their address to an existing instance of their securities. Special care and efforts must be made by the Issuer to secure and safely store their address and associated private key. The Issuer can reassign ownership to another Issuer but not in the case where the Issuer loses their private key.

If the Issuer loses access, the Issuer’s securities must be rebuilt using off-chain services. The Issuer must create (and secure) a new address. The RTA can read the existing Issuer securities, and the RTA can `mint` Investor securities accordingly under a new `ERC-1450` smart contract.

### Registered Transfer Agents who lost access to their address or private keys
If the RTA loses access, the RTA can create a new Ethereum address, and the Issuer can execute the `setTransferAgent` function to reassign the RTA.

### Handling Investors (security owners) who lost access to their addresses or private keys
Investors may “lose” their credentials for a number of reasons: they simply “lost” their credentials, they were hacked or the victim of fraud, they committed securities-related fraud, or a life event (like death) occurred. Because the RTA manages the Issuer’s securities, the RTA may authorize ownership related changes of securities (as long as they are properly notarized and verified).

If an Investor (or, say, the Investor’s heir) loses their credentials, the Investor must go through a notarized process to notify the RTA of the situation and supply a new Investor address. From there, the RTA can `mint` the “lost” securities to the new Investor address and `burnFrom` the old Investor address (because the RTA knows all Investors’ addresses).

## Rationale
The are currently no token standards that facilitate compliance with SEC regulations. The closest token is [ERC-884 (Delaware General Corporations Law (DGCL) compatible share token)](./eip-884.md) which states that SEC requirements are out of scope. [EIP-1404 (Simple Restricted Token Standard)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1404) does not go far enough to address SEC requirements around re-issuing securities to Investors.

## Backwards Compatibility
`ERC-1450` maintains compatibility with ERC-20 tokens with the following stipulations:
* `function allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender) public constant returns (uint remaining);`
  * Must be implemented to always fail because allowance is not a legal, regulated call for a security.
* `function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);`
  * As the token holder initiates the transfer, must be implemented to always fail because transfer is not a legal, regulated call for a security.
* `function approve(address spender, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);`
  * Must be implemented to always fail because approve is not a legal, regulated call for a security
* `function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);`
  * Must be implemented so that only the Issuer’s RTA can perform this action
* `event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender, uint tokens);`
  * Does not have to be implemented. Approval should never be called as the functions that emit this event must be implemented to always fail
