## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the EIP.-->

We define money streaming as continuous payments over a finite period of time. Block timestamps are used as an on-chain proxy for time.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

The following describes a standard whereby time is measured using block timestamps and streams are mappings in a master contract.

1. Developer sets up a money streaming contract.
2. A payer, henceforth referred to as sender, can create a stream by depositing funds in the contract and choosing a streaming duration.
3. A payee, henceforth referred to as recipient, can withdraw money from the stream based on its continuous solvency. That is, `payment * (current block timestamp - starting block timestamp)`.
4. The stream can be terminated by either the sender or the recipient.
5. If the stream ended and has not been terminated, the recipient is entitled to withdraw all the remaining balance.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for EIPs that want to change the Ethereum protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the EIP solves. EIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

This standardised interface takes a stab at changing the way we think about trust in financial contracts. Thanks to blockchains, payments need not be sent in lumps (as with monthly salaries), as there is less overhead in pay-as-you-go. Money as a function of time would better align incentives in a host of scenarios.

### Use Cases

This is just a preliminary list of use cases. There are other interesting ideas left to explore, such as time-dependent disincetivisation, but, for brevity, we have not included them here.

- Salaries
- Insurance
- Subscriptions
- Consultancies
- Rent
- Parking
- Lending

[Sablier](https://sablier.finance) is a champion project for this ERC. It is what we call the protocol for real-time finance.

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (go-ethereum, parity, cpp-ethereum, ethereumj, ethereumjs, and [others](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients)).-->

### Structs

The structure of a stream should be as follows:

  - `Stream`
  - `deposit`: the amount of money to be streamed
  - `ratePerSecond`: the number of tokens allocated each second to the recipient
  - `remainingBalance`: the left in the stream
  - `startTime`: the unix timestamp for when the stream starts
  - `stopTime`: the unix timestamp for when the stream stops
  - `recipient`: the address towards which the money is streamed
  - `sender`: the address of the party funding the stream
  - `tokenAddress`: the ERC20 token to use as streaming currency
  - `isEntity`: indicates whether the stream exists or not

```solidity
struct Stream {
    uint256 deposit;
    uint256 ratePerSecond;
    uint256 remainingBalance;
    uint256 startTime;
    uint256 stopTime;
    address recipient;
    address sender;
    address tokenAddress;
    bool isEntity;
}
```

---

### Methods

#### getStream

Returns the stream object with all its properties.

```solidity
function getStream(uint256 _streamId) view returns (address sender, address recipient, address tokenAddress, uint256 balance, uint256 startBlock, uint256 stopBlock, uint256 payment, uint256 interval)
```

#### balanceOf

Returns the real-time balance of the account with address `who`.

```solidity
function balanceOf(uint256 streamId, address who) view returns (uint256 balance)
```

#### createStream

Creates a new stream funded by `msg.sender` and paid towards `recipient`. MUST throw if `recipient` is the zero address, the contract itself or the caller themselves. MUST throw if `startTime` is before the current block timestamp. MUST throw if `stopTime` is before `startTime`. MUST throw if `deposit` is not a multiple of the time delta. MUST throw if the contract is not allowed to transfer enough tokens.

**Triggers Event**: [CreateStream](#create-stream)

```solidity
function createStream(address recipient, address deposit, address tokenAddress, uint256 startTime, uint256 stopTime) returns (uint256 streamId)
```

#### withdrawFromStream

Withdraws from the contract to the recipient's account.

MUST throw if the caller is not the sender or the recipient. MUST throw if `amount` exceeds the available balance.

**Triggers Event**: [WithdrawFromStream](#withdraw-from-stream)

```solidity
function withdrawFromStream(uint256 streamId, uint256 amount) returns (bool success)
```

#### cancelStream

Cancels the stream and transfers the tokens back on a pro rata basis.

MUST throw if the caller is not the sender or the recipient.

**Triggers Event**: [CancelStream](#cancel-stream)

```solidity
function cancelStream(uint256 streamId) returns (bool success)
```

---

### Events

#### CreateStream

MUST be triggered when `createStream` is successfully called.

```solidity
event CreateStream(uint256 indexed streamId, address indexed sender, address indexed recipient, uint256 deposit, address tokenAddress, uint256 startTime, uint256 stopTime);
```

#### WithdrawFromStream

MUST be triggered when `withdrawFromStream` is successfully called.

```solidity
event WithdrawFromStream(uint256 indexed streamId, address indexed recipient, uint256 amount);
```

#### CancelStream

MUST be triggered when `cancelStream` is successfully called.

```solidity
event CancelStream(uint256 indexed streamId, address indexed sender, address indexed recipient, uint256 senderBalance, uint256 recipientBalance);
```

## Rationale

<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This specification is designed to serve as an entry point to the quirky concept of money as a function of time. It is definitely not set in stone. Several other designs, including payment channels have been considered, but they were deemed dense in assumptions unnecessary for an initial draft.

### Timestamps

Block timestamps are a reasonably secure proxy for time on the blockchain. Although miners handle them, there are game-theoretical incentives to not provide malicious timestamps. [Read this thread](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/413/can-a-contract-safely-rely-on-block-timestamp) on StackExchange for more details.

The only dangerous scenario we can think of is when ERC-1620 derived implementations end up making up a significant share of the volume of money transferred on Ethereum. It is possible, although unlikely, that some stream recipients will have an incentive to coax miners in bumping the block timestamps for them to profit. But we posit the payoff (a few seconds or minutes times the payment rate) will not be high enough for this kind of attack to be worth it.

## Implementation

<!--The implementations must be completed before any EIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the EIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
