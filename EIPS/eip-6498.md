## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for document signing using smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to track and sign documents.

Right now, financial assets and intellectual property are accompanied with a legal framework of usage rights. Licenses about these rights are expressed and subjected to the terms and conditions that govern how users own or interact with a product or platform.

Everyone’s familiar with the standardized “agree to the following terms and conditions” that accompany the use of various websites and products.

But how do such licenses exist on a blockchain today?

It’s a thorny problem, especially for complex financial products.

Enter Polydocs: We have created a smart document and added meta-signing that makes it easy and safe to own or allocate complicated intellectual, financial, and rights-oriented digital assets on the blockchain. These assets are more complex than the cash or deeds we sometimes use for analogies. Some of the most common examples of these assets are:

- NFT's with intellectual property that involve rights and responsibilities (eg: Music NFT's, real world assets like real estate).
- Financial instruments such as SMB loans require acceptance on both sides.
- Communities need agreement on government by norms and rules.
- KYC/AML documents that need to be signed by both parties.

## Motivation

Smart contracts are increasingly used for managing the allocation of digital assets. These assets are more complex than the cash or deeds we sometimes use for analogies. Intellectual property involves rights and responsibilities. Financial instruments require acceptance on both sides. Communities need agreement on government by norms and rules.

The articulation and acceptance of these terms should be a first-class consideration for those creating digital assets and services. That's why we made Polydocs.

## Specification

**Note**: The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Rationale

Say a financial institution wants to provide more crypto-native offerings or finance Web3 businesses, but they’re legally required to perform Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks.

After a user enters the required information for KYC (which, in the future, can be backed by privacy-oriented solutions like zk-powered PolygonID), the user can attest to having performed the KYC, with a link to the documentation provided by Polydocs.

Suddenly, financial organizations, with access to a ton of capital, have the compliance attestations and legal framework to avert risk. They can begin to open up capital to users have been de-risked using this KYC/AML process.

By creating a framework to sign smart documents and demystify smart contracts, Polydocs can help bridge the gap between traditional industries and crypto ecosystem.

## Backwards Compatibility

Function names are all distinct from existing ERC standards as of February 8th, 2023.

## Reference Implementation

gmSign (https://admin.gmsign.xyz/) was built during HelloSign Hackathon in 2022. It lets you mint NFT's with "Can't Be Evil" licenses from a16z. gmSign connects HelloSign with decentralized applications by enabling signatures over the HelloSign API which, on callback, makes a gasless record of that signature on-chain so that there is clarity as to who signed which agreement when. This record of sign is maintained by Polydocs in a public registry of signed documents.

Polydocs (https://polydocs.xyz/) was built during HackFS and Polygon's Buidl It Hackathons in 2022. It comprises of 3 core parts:

- Signing App (https://sign.polydocs.xyz) is a gasless mini-app to enable a customer to accept the terms of an agreement and get recorded on the blockchain using a metatransaction.
- Admin App (https://admin.polydocs.xyz) is a gasless admin system for creating, deploying and managing contracts with polydocs agreements.
- A known templates registry of documents hosted on IPFS.

An exmaple implementation of Polydocs can be found at https://github.com/statechangelabs/Polydocs-EIP/blob/main/hardhat_project/contracts/Registry.sol. As in the case of 721, implementation of minting templates is left to the discretion of the developer. Our Registry.sol contract is an example implementation of a registry of templates.

## Security Considerations

### Legal meaning of wallet based signatures

The legal meaning of a signature is a complex topic. In the US, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) defines a signature as "an electronic sound, symbol, or process attached to or logically associated with a record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record." This definition is broad enough to include a signature in a blockchain transaction, but it is not clear whether it would be considered a valid signature for a contract. The UETA also states that "a signature is not invalid solely because it is in electronic form or because it is an electronic sound, symbol, or process." This means that a signature in a blockchain transaction is not necessarily invalid, but it is not clear whether it would be considered a valid signature for a contract.

We are using mathmatical signatures to express intent to sign a document. Wallets are usually pseudonymous and the signature is not necessarily tied to a person. This means that the signature is not necessarily invalid, but it is not clear whether it would be considered a valid signature for a contract.

### Privacy leak of confidential information

Anything that is signed on a public blockchain is visible to everyone. This means that if a user signs a document that contains confidential information, that information will be visible to everyone.
There is an interesting opportunity for people who are public about their Wallet identity (eg: people with ENS domains) to associate one's identity with one's adddress which would signficantly decrease the barrier to entry with KYC type contracts and increase the legality of wallet based signatures.
