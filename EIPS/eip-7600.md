## Abstract

This Meta EIP lists the EIPs formally considered for and included in the Prague/Electra network upgrade. 

## Specification

### Included EIPs 

* [EIP-2537](./eip-2537.md): Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations
* [EIP-6110](./eip-6110.md): Supply validator deposits on chain

### Full Specifications 

#### Consensus Layer

EIP-6110 and EIP-7002 require changes to Ethereum's consensus layer. While the EIPs present an overview of these changes, the full specifications can be found in the `_features` directory of the `ethereum/consensus-specs` repository: [6110](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/19edc2d1ec9d17dd2e84d4ed727ebf6451abb1b9/specs/_features/eip6110), [7002](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/19edc2d1ec9d17dd2e84d4ed727ebf6451abb1b9/specs/_features/eip7002).

#### Execution Layer

EIP-2537, EIP-6110 and EIP-7002 require changes to Ethereum's execution layer. The EIPs fully specify those changes.
