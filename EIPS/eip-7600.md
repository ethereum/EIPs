### Full Specifications 

#### Consensus Layer

EIP-6110, EIP-7002 EIP-7251, EIP-7549 and EIP-7594 require changes to Ethereum's consensus layer. While the EIPs present an overview of these changes, the full specifications can be found in the `specs/electra` and `specs/_features` directories of the `ethereum/consensus-specs` repository.

#### Execution Layer

All EOF EIPs, listed in EIP-7692, as well as EIP-2537, EIP-2935, EIP-6110, EIP-7685, and EIP-7002 require changes to Ethereum's execution layer. The EIPs fully specify those changes. 

### Activation 

| Network Name     | Activation Epoch | Activation Timestamp |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Sepolia          |                  |                      |
| Hole≈°ky          |                  |                      |
| Mainnet          |                  |                      |

**Note**: rows in the table above will be filled as activation times are decided by client teams. 

## Rationale

This Meta EIP provides a global view of all changes included in the Prague/Electra network upgrade, as well as links to full specification. 

## Security Considerations

None.
