### EIPs Proposed for Inclusion

For clarity, and due to the late addition of this section in the Pectra network upgrade planning process, only EIPs which have recently been proposed or discussed are listed here. For the full list of Pectra proposals, please refer to the `discussion-to` link for this EIP. If the author has missed relevant EIPs in this section, please propose additions by opening a pull request.  

* [EIP-6493](./eip-6493.md): SSZ Transaction Signature Scheme
* [EIP-7495](./eip-7495.md): SSZ StableContainer
* [EIP-7688](./eip-7688.md): Forward compatible consensus data structures
* [EIP-7761](./eip-7761.md): IS_CONTRACT instruction

### Full Specifications 

Only EIPs Scheduled for Inclusion are mentioned in this section. 

#### Consensus Layer

EIP-6110, EIP-7002 EIP-7251, EIP-7549 and EIP-7594 require changes to Ethereum's consensus layer. While the EIPs present an overview of these changes, the full specifications can be found in the `specs/electra` and `specs/_features` directories of the `ethereum/consensus-specs` repository.

#### Execution Layer

All EOF EIPs, listed in EIP-7692, as well as EIP-2537, EIP-2935, EIP-6110, EIP-7002, EIP-7685, and EIP-7702 require changes to Ethereum's execution layer. The EIPs fully specify those changes. 

### Activation 

| Network Name     | Activation Epoch | Activation Timestamp |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Sepolia          |                  |                      |
| Hole≈°ky          |                  |                      |
| Mainnet          |                  |                      |

**Note**: rows in the table above will be filled as activation times are decided by client teams. 

## Rationale

This Meta EIP provides a global view of all changes included in the Prague/Electra network upgrade, as well as links to full specification. 

## Security Considerations

None.
