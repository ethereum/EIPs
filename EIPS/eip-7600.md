### Full Specifications 

#### Consensus Layer

EIP-6110, EIP-7002 EIP-7251 and EIP-7549 require changes to Ethereum's consensus layer. While the EIPs present an overview of these changes, the full specifications can be found in the `specs/electra` and `specs/_features` directories of the `ethereum/consensus-specs` repository.

#### Execution Layer

EIP-2537, EIP-2935, EIP-6110, EIP-7685, EIP-7002 and EIP-7702 require changes to Ethereum's execution layer. The EIPs fully specify those changes. 

### Activation
