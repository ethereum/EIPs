description: A protocol for tokenizing smart contracts, allowing for their identification, management, and integration into marketplaces via unique identifiers and metadata management.
---

## Abstract

This EIP introduces a protocol for the tokenization of smart contracts, facilitating their identification, management, and integration into marketplaces. It outlines the creation of contract instances with unique identifiers, alongside ownership and metadata management, to support their sale, purchase, and collection.

## Motivation

The advancement of blockchain technology and the proliferation of decentralized applications (dApps) underscore the need for a dynamic, interoperable protocol for managing smart contracts. A standardized mechanism for tokenization, exchange, and aggregation is necessary. This EIP, with its ERC-321Metadata extension, proposes a structured interface for lifecycle management of smart contracts within marketplaces.


## Specification

**ERC-321 Interface:**

```solidity
interface IERC321Metadata is IERC321 {
    function tokenURI(uint256 contractId) external view returns (string memory);
}
```

## Rationale

This standard addresses the need for a systematic approach to smart contract tokenization, facilitating the safe sale and transfer of smart contracts on marketplaces. It lays the foundation for an acquisitions market and a legal framework for smart contract sales and trade.

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation provided demonstrates the application of this EIP in creating and managing tokenized smart contracts with unique identifiers and metadata.

## Security Considerations

Securing the implementation of ERC-321 is crucial, focusing on managing contract ownership and metadata integrity. Adhering to smart contract security best practices and opting for decentralized storage solutions for metadata are essential to mitigate risks.

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-321 is designed with backward compatibility in mind, ensuring seamless interaction with existing ERC standards and the broader Ethereum ecosystem.
