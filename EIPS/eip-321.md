A standard for applying contractId's to SmartContracts, enabling ease in transferring smart contract ownership in marketplaces.
**authors:** Larry Klosowski @QuFoamLabs <larryklosowski@proton.me> 
**discussions-to:** n/a
**status:** Draft
**type:** Standards
**category:** ERC  
**created:** 02/02/2024
**requires:** 321

### Abstract
ERC-321 introduces a protocol for the tokenization of smart contracts, enabling their identification, management, and integration into marketplaces. This standard provides a systematic approach to creating contract instances with unique identifiers, managing ownership, and handling metadata. It aims to support the sale, purchase, and collection of smart contracts, facilitating their use as assets with defined ownership and characteristics.

### Motivation
The advancement of blockchain technology and the proliferation of decentralized applications (dApps) highlight the necessity for a protocol that can manage smart contracts more dynamically and interoperably. There exists a notable requirement for a standardized mechanism that supports the tokenization, exchange, and aggregation of smart contracts. ERC-321, along with the ERC-321Metadata extension, is designed to meet this need by offering a structured interface for smart contract lifecycle management within marketplaces. This enables the effective packaging and monetization of smart contracts, addressing the growing market for smart contract acquisition and legal trade.

### Specification
**ERC-321 Interface:**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.23;

/**
 * @title IERC321 Smart Contract Tokenization Interface
 * @dev Interface for tokenization and management of smart contracts, facilitating identification and enabling interactions like creation and metadata management.
 */
interface IERC321 {
    event ContractInstanceCreated(address indexed instance, uint256 indexed contractId);
    function createInstance(bytes calldata _metadata) external returns (uint256 contractId);
}
```

**ERC-321Metadata Extension:**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.23;

/**
 * @title IERC321 Smart Contract Tokenization Interface
 * @dev Interface for the tokenization and management of smart contracts, facilitating their identification, and enabling interactions like creation and metadata management.
 */
interface IERC321 {
    /**
     * @dev Emitted when a new smart contract instance is created and tokenized.
     * @param instance Address of the created smart contract instance.
     * @param contractId Unique identifier for the tokenized contract instance.
     */
    event ContractInstanceCreated(address indexed instance, uint256 indexed contractId);

    /**
     * @notice Creates a new tokenized smart contract instance with associated metadata.
     * @param _metadata Encoded metadata associated with the smart contract instance.
     * @return contractId The unique identifier assigned to the created smart contract instance.
     */
    function createInstance(bytes calldata _metadata) external returns (uint256 contractId);
}

/**
 * @title IERC321Metadata Interface Extension
 * @dev Extension of the IERC321 interface to support metadata operations.
 */
interface IERC321Metadata is IERC321 {
    /**
     * @notice Retrieves the metadata URI for a given contract ID.
     * @param contractId The unique identifier of the tokenized smart contract instance.
     * @return The URI of the metadata associated with the specified contract instance.
     */
    function tokenURI(uint256 contractId) external view returns (string memory);
}
```

### Rationale
The ERC-321 standard addresses the need for a systematic approach to smart contract tokenization, enabling the safe sale and transfer of smart contracts on marketplaces. It lays the foundation for an acquisitions market and a legal framework for smart contract sales and trade, by providing the necessary infrastructure for assigning unique identifiers to contract instances, managing ownership, and associating metadata. This standard simplifies the integration of contracts into existing and future dApps and platforms, promoting a structured marketplace where contracts can be efficiently traded and managed.

### Security Considerations
Ensuring the secure implementation of ERC-321 is crucial, with a particular emphasis on managing contract ownership and safeguarding metadata integrity. Following best practices in smart contract security and opting for decentralized storage solutions for metadata are essential steps to mitigate risks and prevent central points of failure.

### Backwards Compatibility
Designed with backward compatibility in mind, ERC-321 ensures a seamless interaction with existing ERC standards and the Ethereum ecosystem at large. This facilitates the standard's adoption, enabling its practical implementation in current systems and technologies.
