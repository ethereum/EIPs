## Simple Summary
This EIP defines a HTTP API standard for a BLS remote signer, consumed by validator clients to sign block proposals and attestations in the context of Ethereum 2.0 (eth2).

## Abstract
A [validator](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/validator.md) client contributes to the consensus of the Eth2 blockchain by signing proposals and attestations of blocks, using a BLS private key which must be available to this client at all times.

The BLS remote signer API is designed to be consumed by validator clients, looking for a more secure avenue to store their BLS12-381 private key(s), enabling them to run in more permissive and scalable environments.

## Motivation
Eth2 utilizes [BLS12-381](https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature/) signatures.

Consensus on the eth2 Blockchain is achieved via the proposal and attestation of blocks from validator clients, using a BLS private key (_signing_ key) which must be available each time a message is signed: that is, at least once every epoch (6.4 minutes), during a small window of time within this epoch (a _slot_, i.e. 12 seconds), as each validator is expected to attest exactly once per epoch.

The [eth2 specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs) does not explicitly provide a directive on where this BLS private key must/should be stored, leaving this implementation detail to the client teams, who assume that this cryptographic secret is stored on the same host as the validator client.

This assumption is sufficient in the use case where the validator client is running in a physically secure network (i.e. nobody, but the operator, has a chance to log-in into the machine hosting the validator client), as such configuration would only allow _outbound_ calls from the validator client. In this situation, only a physical security breach, or a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability can allow an attacker to either have arbitrary access to the storage or to the memory of the device.

There are, however, use cases where it is required by the operator to run a validator client node in less constrained security environments, as the ones given by a cloud provider. Notwithstanding any security expectation, nothing prevents a rogue operator from gaining arbitrary access to the assets running inside a node.

The situation is not better when the requirement is to execute the validators by leveraging a container orchestration solution (e.g. Kubernetes). The handling of secret keys across nodes can become a burden both from an operational as well as a security perspective.

The proposed solution comprises running a specialized node with exclusive access to the secret keys, listening to a simple API (defined in the [Specification](#specification) section), and returning the requested signatures. Operators working under this schema must utilize clients with the adequate feature supporting the consumption of this API.

The focus of this specification is the supply of BLS signatures _on demand_. The aspects of authentication, key management (creation, update, and deletion), and transport encryption are discussed in the [Rationale](#rationale) section of this document. Moreover, the [Threat Model](#threat-model) section of this document provides a (non-exhaustive) list of threats and attack vectors, along with the suggested related mitigation strategy.

## Rationale

### UNIX philosophy: Simple API

This API specification contains only three methods: one for **status**, one for **listing the available keys**, and one to **produce a signature**. There are no methods for authentication, key management, nor transport encryption.

The following subsections discuss aspects to be considered by the client implementers relative to these subjects.

#### Implementation of additional features

From an API pipeline view, we have two nodes: The validator client (1) that makes requests to the remote signer (2). A more sophisticated chain can be built by introducing elements between these two nodes. Either by setting up reverse proxy services, or by adding plugins to the remote signer implementation.

#### Authentication

Can be accomplished through the use of an HTTP Request Header. There are several ways to negotiate and issue a valid token to authenticate the communication between the validator client and the remote signer, each of them with potential drawbacks (e.g replay attacks, challenges in distributing the token to the validator client, etc.). In general, any method of authentication must be combined with transport encryption to be effective.

The operator can also implement network Access Control Lists (ACLs) between the validator client's network and the remote signer's network, reducing the attack surface by requiring a potential attacker to be positioned in the same network as the validator client.

#### Key management

There are several ways to store secret keys, namely Hardware Security Modules (HSM), Secrets management applications (e.g. Hashicorp Vault), cloud storage with tight private network ACL rules, or even raw files in a directory. In general the remote signer implementers will abstract the storage medium from the HTTP API.

It is in this perspective, that any procedure to create, update, or delete keys should be built separate from the client implementation.

#### Transport Encryption

If the operator is working with self-signed certificates, it is required that the client enhancement consuming the remote signer allows this option.
