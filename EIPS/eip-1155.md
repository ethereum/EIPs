## Simple Summary

A standard interface for contracts that manage multiple token types. A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, or other configurations (for example, semi-fungible tokens).

## Abstract

This standard outlines a smart contract interface where one can represent any number of Fungible and Non-Fungible tokens in a single contract. Existing standards such as ERC-20 require deployment of separate contracts per token. The ERC-721 standard's Token ID is a single non-fungible index and the group of these non-fungibles is deployed as a single contract with settings for the entire collection. In contrast, the ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard allows for each Token ID to represent a new configurable token type, which may have its own metadata, supply and other attributes.

The `_id` parameter is contained in each function's parameters and indicates a specific token or token type in a transaction.

## Motivation

Tokens standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 require a separate contract to be deployed for each fungible or NFT token/collection. This places a lot of redundant bytecode on the Ethereum blockchain and limits certain functionality by the nature of separating each token contract into its own permissioned address. With the rise of crypto games and platforms like [Enjin Coin](https://enjincoin.io/), game developers may be creating thousands of tokens, and a new type of token standard is needed to support this.

New functionality is possible with this design, such as transferring or approving multiple token types at once, saving on transaction costs. Trading (escrow / atomic swaps) of multiple tokens can be built on top of this standard and it removes the need to "approve" individual tokens separately. It is also easy to describe and mix multiple fungible or non-fungible tokens in a single contract.

### Batch Transfers

The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function allows for batch transfers of multiple token ids and values. Gas savings improves with the number of token types in the batch transfer, compared to single transfers with multiple transactions.

The `safeMulticastTransferFrom` function allows for multicast transfers to and from multiple addresses. It's also possible to create a simple atomic swap, including any fee structure required, by obtaining approvals from the source and destination parties.

### Backwards Compatibility

This standard is compatible with ERC-721 non-fungible tokens. Both interfaces can be inherited without conflict:

```solidity
contract MultiTokens is ERC1155, ERC721 {
    ...
}
```

## Enumerating from events

In order to keep storage requirements light for contracts implementing ERC-1155, enumeration (discovering the IDs and values of tokens) must be done using event logs. It is RECOMMENDED that clients such as exchanges and blockchain explorers maintain a local database containing the Token ID, Supply, and URI at the minimum. This can be built from each Transfer and URI event, starting from the block the smart contract was deployed until the latest block.

ERC-1155 contracts must therefore carefully emit Transfer events in any instance where tokens are created, minted, or destroyed.

## Metadata

The URI value allows for ID substitution by clients. If the string {id} exists in any URI, clients MUST replace this with the actual token ID. This allows for large number of tokens to use the same on-chain string by defining a URI once, for a large collection of tokens. Example of such a URI: `https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json`

### ERC-1155 Metadata URI JSON Schema

This JSON schema is loosely based on the "ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema", but includes optional formatting to allow for ID substitution by clients. If the string {id} exists in any JSON value, it MUST be replaced with the actual token ID, by all client software that follows this standard.

```json
{
    "title": "Token Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Identifies the asset to which this token represents",
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describes the asset to which this token represents",
        },
        "image": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this token represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive.",
        },
        "properties": {
            "type": "object",
            "description": "Arbitrary properties. Values may be strings, numbers, object or arrays.",
        },
    }
}
```

An example of an ERC-1155 Metadata JSON file follows. The properties array proposes some SUGGESTED formatting for token-specific display properties and metadata.

```json
{
	"name": "Asset Name",
	"description": "Lorem ipsum...",
	"image": "https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/your-bucket\/images\/{id}.png",
	"properties": {
		"simple_property": "example value",
		"rich_property": {
			"name": "Name",
			"value": "123",
			"display_value": "123 Example Value",
			"class": "emphasis",
			"css": {
				"color": "#ffffff",
				"font-weight": "bold",
				"text-decoration": "underline"
			}
		},
		"array_property": {
			"name": "Name",
			"value": [1,2,3,4],
			"class": "emphasis"
		}
	}
}
```

### Metadata Extensions

The following optional extensions can be identified with the (ERC-165 Standard Interface Detection)[https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-165.md].

Changes to the URI or Name MUST emit their corresponding events if the change can be expressed with an event. If the optional ERC1155Metadata_URI or ERC1155Metadata_Name extensions are included, the values returned by these functions SHOULD be used to retrieve values for which no event was emitted. The functions MUST return the same value as the event if it was emitted.

```solidity
interface ERC1155Metadata_URI {
    /**
        @notice A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given token
        @dev URIs are defined in RFC 3986
        @return URI string
    */
    function uri(uint256 _id) external view returns (string);
}

interface ERC1155Metadata_Name {
    /**
        @notice A human-readable name for a given token
        @return Name string
    */
    function name(uint256 _id) external view returns (string);
}
```

## ERC-1155 Token Receiver

Smart contracts **MUST** implement this interface to accept safe transfers.

```solidity
interface ERC1155TokenReceiver {
    /**
        @notice Handle the receipt of an ERC1155 type
        @dev The smart contract calls this function on the recipient
        after a `safeTransferFrom`. This function MAY throw to revert and reject the
        transfer. Return of other than the magic value MUST result in the
        transaction being reverted
        Note: the contract address is always the message sender
        @param _operator  The address which called `safeTransferFrom` function
        @param _from      The address which previously owned the token
        @param _id        The identifier of the token being transferred
        @param _value     The amount of the token being transferred
        @param _data      Additional data with no specified format
        @return           `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)"))`
    */
    function onERC1155Received(address _operator, address _from, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes _data) external returns(bytes4);
}
```

<details>
<summary>
Non-Fungible Tokens</summary>

### Usage Intention

This standard can be used to represent multiple token types for an entire domain. Both Fungible and Non-Fungible tokens can be stored in the same smart-contract.

#### Non-Fungible Example

An example strategy to mix Fungible and Non-Fungible tokens together in the same contract would be to pass the base token ID in the top 128 bits of the uint256 `_id` parameter and then use the bottom 128 bits for any extra data you wish to pass to the contract.

Non-Fungible tokens can be interacted with using an index based accessor into the contract/token data set. Therefore to access a particular token set within a mixed data contract and particular NFT within that set, `_id` could be passed as `<uint128: base token id><uint128: index of NFT>`.

Inside the contract code the two pieces of data needed to access the individual NFT can be extracted with uint128(~0) and the same mask shifted by 128.

### Example of split ID bits

```solidity
uint256 baseToken = 12345 << 128;
uint128 index = 50;

balanceOf(baseToken, msg.sender); // Get balance of the base token
balanceOf(baseToken + index, msg.sender); // Get balance of the Non-Fungible token index
```
