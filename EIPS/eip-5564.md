## Abstract
This specification defines a standardized way of creating stealth addresses for smart contract wallets. This EIP enables senders of transactions/transfers to generate private stealth addresses for their recipients that only the recipient can eventually unlock.

## Motivation
The standardization of stealth address generation may unlock significant privacy potential within Smart Contract Wallets, allowing the recipient of a transfer to remain private when receiving an asset. A Stealth address is generated by the sender from a shared secret between sender and recipient and can only be unlocked by the recipient because only the recipient can compute the matching private key.

Observers have no possibility of linking the recipient's stealth address to the recipient's identity, leaving only the sender with that information.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Every smart contract compliant with this EIP wallet MUST implement the [EIP-165](./eip-165.md) (`0x01ffc9a7`) interface.

#### Stealth Address Generation (executed locally)

```solidity
function generateStealthAddress(uint256 secret) public view returns (bytes, address){
        //  s*G = S
        pubkeyFromSecret = ecMul(secret, G);
        //  s*P = q
        sharedSecret = ecMul(secret, Publickey);
        // hash(sharedSecret)
        hashedSharedSecret = keccak256(sharedSecret);
        // hash value to public key
        pubkeyFromHashedSecret = ecMul(hashedSharedSecret, G);
        // derive new public key
        stealthPubkeyRecipient = ecAdd(Publickey, pubkeyFromHashedSecret);
        // generate stealth address
        stealthAddressRecipient = address(stealthPubkeyRecipient);
        // return public key coordinates and stealthAddress
        return (pubkeyFromSecret, stealthAddressRecipient);
    }
```


---

#### For transfering:

Recipient Keypair --> $(p,P) | P = p * G$


##### Recipient:
```solidity
bytes public pubkeyRecipient;
```
NOTE: `pubkeyRecipient` MUST be incorporated in the smart contract wallet contract as a public state variable.

---

##### Sender:

Sender senderKeypair  --> $(s,S) | S = s * G $
```solidity
bytes pubkeyFromSecret = ecMul(s, G);
```
NOTE: The parameter `s` represents a sender-generated secret and MUST NOT equal a user's private key.

$sharedSecret    = s * P$

```solidity
bytes sharedSecret = ecMul(s, pubkeyRecipient);
```




stealthAddress  = $pubtoaddr(P + (G * keccak(sharedSecret)))$
```solidity
bytes32 hashedSharedSecret = keccak256(sharedSecret);
bytes pubkeyFromHashedSecret = ecMul(hashedSharedSecret, G);
bytes stealthPubkeyRecipient = ecAdd(pubkeyRecipient, pubkeyFromHashedSecret);
address stealthAddressRecipient = address(stealthPubkeyRecipient);
```
Transfer MUST emit a `PrivateTransfer` Event containing `S` and the `stealthAddressRecipient`.


---


#### For receiving (executed locally):

for all `PrivateTransfer` events do:

if $pubtoaddr(P + (G * keccak(S * p)))$ == $stealthAddressRecipient$:
```solidity
bytes32 hashedSecret = keccak256(S);
bytes sharedSecret = ecMul(hashedSecret, p);
bytes pubkeyFromSharedSecret = ecMul(sharedSecret, G);
bytes stealthPubkeyRecipient = ecAdd(pubkeyRecipient, pubkeyFromSharedSecret);
address stealthAddressRecipient = address(stealthPubkeyRecipient);
store_key_locally(p + keccak(S * p));
```


## Rationale
This EIP emerged from the need of having privacy-preserving ways to transfer ownership without revealing the recipient's identity. Tokens can reveal sensitive private information about the owner. While users might want to prove the ownership of an NFT concert ticket, they might not want to reveal personal account-related information at the same time. The standardization of stealth address generation represents a significant effort for privacy. Privacy-preserving solutions require standards to gain adoption, therefore it is critical to focus on generalizable ways of implementing related solutions.

This extension standardizes the method to generate and look up stealth addresses. Users can send assets without having to interact with the recipient beforehand. Furthermore, users can verify if they have been the recipient of a transfer without requiring interactions with the chain. Stealth addresses allow only the recipients of token transfers to see that they were the recipients.


## Backwards Compatibility
No backward compatibility issues were found.

## Reference Implementation
You can find an implementation of this standard in [gnosisSafeModule.sol](../assets/eip-5564/gnosisSafeModule.sol).

## Security Considerations
The funding of the stealth address wallet represents a known issue that might breach privacy. The wallet that funds the stealth address wallet MUST NOT have any physical connection to the stealth address owner in order to fully leverage the privacy improvements.
