## Abstract

Historically, transaction payloads in Ethereum only defined their inputs, while the behavior and the outcome of
transactions is only defined by the code permanently deployed on-chain.
With the growing complexity of the deployed codebases and the growing monetary value controlled by this code,
such an approach becomes increasingly more dangerous.

This proposal, for the first time, allows the transaction payload to define some guardrails, which will empower Ethereum users to restrict the behavior of the deployed on-chain codebases.

## Motivation

The total value of crypto assets that have been stolen to date allegedly exceeds the yearly GDP of a medium-sized nation.
This level of loss and waste is indefensible and has a long list of negative consequences for everyone involved.

Specifically, one of the major ways by which Ethereum users end up losing their funds is not exposing private keys,
but instead being tricked into signing transactions that appear innocent in their Wallet applications but in practice
perform a complete sweep of the senders' assets.

This situation is largely a result of two factors and must be addressed urgently.

First, the ability of an average user to find, review, and analyze the code the transaction will execute is very limited.
Second, the ability of a Wallet application to autonomously and reliably analyze this information is even more limited.

This means that have no mechanism to enforce any limits on what transactions will actually do once they are signed,
and leaves a vast majority of users forced to perform blind signing in order to interact with Ethereum,
exposing them to an unreasonable level of risk.

By providing the Wallets and dApps with the ability to restrict the possible **outcomes** of a transaction,
we can create a tool that users and wallets will apply to reduce their risk levels.

## Specification

### New Transaction Type

We introduce a new [EIP-2718](./eip-2718.md) transaction, "restricted execution transaction", where the `TransactionType` is `RESTRICTED_EXECUTION_TX_TYPE` and the `TransactionPayload` is the RLP serialization of the following:

```
rlp([chain_id, nonce, max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit, destination, value, data, access_list, authorization_list, execution_restrictions, signature_y_parity, signature_r, signature_s])
```

### Execution Restrictions

There are a number of parameters that constitute the core of the transaction's execution restriction.
These parameters are joined together and RLP encoded as part of the transaction payload.
There are no additional costs associated with providing this parameter other than its gas cost equivalent to `calldata`.

In case any of the specified restrictions is violated, the entire transaction is **reverted on-chain**
and its gas is paid until the point of the restriction violation.

The transaction is a valid transaction that can be included in a block and pays its own gas regardless of the contents
of the `execution_restrictions` parameter.

#### Storage Altering Operations

The term "permitted operation" is defined as follows:

* `READ` - read-only access to the given slot
* `DECREASE` - read and decrease a value in the given slot
* `INCREASE` - read and increase a value in the given slot
* `DELTA` - read and either `INCREASE` or `DECREASE` a value in the given slot
* `WRITE` - any storage read or write operation in the given slot
* `TRANSIENT_WRITE` - any storage read or write operation in the given slot is allowed **during** the execution, but must remain unchanged as a result of the transaction

For the `DELTA`, `INCREASE`, and `DECREASE` the value stored in the slot is treated as an unsigned integer value.

#### Explicitly Permitted Operations

By default `RESTRICTED_EXECUTION_TX_TYPE` transactions are not permitted to perform the following operations:

1. Modifying any account's `balance`
2. Modifying any account's storage slots
3. Executing any of the [Opcodes Restricted by Default](#opcodes-restricted-by-default)

The `permitted_operations` field provides a description of what operations are permitted as part of the transaction's execution.
The operations described by this field are permitted for the specified addresses.

##### Wildcard Permitted Operation

Providing the special value `[0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, [], []]` indicates that all
operations are permitted for all addresses not explicitly mentioned in either the [Explicitly Permitted Operations](#explicitly-permitted-operations) or [Explicitly Banned Operations](#explicitly-banned-operations) lists.

#### Explicitly Banned Operations

The term "banned operation" is defined as follows:

* `ANY` - **any** read and write access to the given slot
* `DECREASE` - decrease of a value in the given slot
* `INCREASE` - increase of a value in the given slot
* `WRITE` - write access to the given slot

Unlike the `permitted_operations`, all `INCREASE` and `DECREASE` operations are banned regardless of the amount the value changes.
There is no `DELTA` operation defined for the banned operations.

In case there is a conflict between a permit list and a ban list, the **ban list takes precedence**, and the transaction **reverts** upon violation.

#### Opcodes Restricted by Default

The following opcodes have non-local effects and their applications are restricted by `RESTRICTED_EXECUTION_TX_TYPE` by default:

* `SELFDESTRUCT` (`0xFF`)
* `DELEGATECALL` (`0xF4`)
* `CALLCODE` (`0xF2`)
* `STATICCALL` (`0xFA`)
* `CALL` (`0xFA`)
* `CREATE` (`0xF0`)
* `CREATE2` (`0xF5`)
* `LOG` (`0xA0`)
* `LOG1` (`0xA1`)
* `LOG2` (`0xA2`)
* `LOG3` (`0xA3`)
* `LOG4` (`0xA4`)

Additionally, we introduce special values for non-opcode-based restrictions:

* All opcodes (`0xffff`) - used to explicitly permit or ban all opcodes for an address
* `CALL` with value (`0xff00`) - used to explicitly permit or ban calls only if they carry a value in native currency
* Current contract deployment (`0xff01`) - preventing the specified address from having a code inserted in its place
* Reverted call (`0xff02`) - preventing the specified address from executing any reverted call

Consequently, all EIPs defining new opcodes must specify whether the opcode should be restricted by default or not.

### New opcode `TXRESTRICTHASH`

With the growing adoption of Account Abstraction, it is important to expose the `execution_restrictions` value
to the Smart Contract Wallets.

The new `TXRESTRICTHASH` opcode pushes the following value onto the stack:

```
keccak256(execution_restrictions)
```

### Revert Reason

When executed in a view mode, a `RESTRICTED_EXECUTION_TX_TYPE` transaction with an `execution_restrictions` violation
returns with the following revert reason:

```
error ExecutionRestrictionViolation(address _address, bytes32 _slot, bytes32 _opcode);
```

Where:

* `_address` - the violating contract's address
* `_slot` - the storage slot that has caused a violation, or `0x0` if not slot-related
* `_opcode` - the exact opcode that has caused the rule violation

### RLP-encoding of the "Execution Restrictions" Parameter

The value of the `execution_restrictions` parameter is expressed as a
two-element `[permitted_operations, banned_operations]` RLP tuple.

#### Permitted Operations

We define the following constants to express various [permitted operations](#storage-altering-operations):

* `0x00` - permit `READ` operation
* `0x01` - permit `DECREASE` operation
* `0x02` - permit `INCREASE` operation
* `0x03` - permit `DELTA` operation
* `0x04` - permit `WRITE` operation

The `DELTA`, `INCREASE`, and `DECREASE` operations are expressed as a two-element `[operation, value]` RLP tuple.

The `permitted_operations` parameter is represented by an array of the following internal structure:

1. Address of an account with explicitly permitted operations.
2. Account balance permitted operation type, expressed as `[operation, value]` RLP tuple.
3. An array of permitted operations per storage slot.
   If left empty, all slots are permitted for arbitrary read and write.
   If the same slot ID appears multiple types, each operation is permitted for the given slot.
   * Storage Slot Identifier
   * Permitted "operation"
   * Maximum permitted amount (optional)
4. An array of explicitly permitted [Restricted Opcodes](#opcodes-restricted-by-default).

Example of a `permitted_operations` encoding:

```
rlp(
  [
    [0xAddress1, [0x01, 0xde0b6b3a7640000], [[0xSlotID1, [0x00]], [0xSlotID2, [0x01]], ["0xF4", "0xF5"]]],
    [0xAddress2, [0x02, de0b6b3a7640000], [0xSlotID, [0x02, 0x777]]],
    [0xAddress3, [], [0xSlotID, [0x00]]],
  ]
)
```

#### Banned Operations

* `0x00` - ban `ANY` operation
* `0x01` - ban `DECREASE` operation
* `0x02` - ban `INCREASE` operation
* `0x04` - ban `WRITE` operation

The `banned_operations` parameter is represented by an array of the following internal structure:

1. Address of an account with explicitly banned operations
2. Account balance banned operation type, expressed as `operation` value.
3. An array of banned operations per storage slot. If left empty, all slots are banned for `ANY` operation.
   * Storage Slot Identifier
   * Banned "operation"
4. An array of explicitly banned opcodes. May contain any valid opcode value.

Example of a `banned_operations` encoding:

```
rlp(
  [
    [0xAddress1, 0x01, [[0xSlotID1, 0x00], [0xSlotID2, 0x01], ["0xF4", "0xF5"]]],
    [0xAddress2, 0x04, [0xSlotID, 0x02]], []],
  ]
)
```

## Rationale

### Explicitly Banned Operations Rationale

In general, providing this value should be less preferable compared to making transactions with only a list
of explicitly permitted operations and an outright ban on any other access.

This, however, is not practical with the current diversity of pre-existing smart contracts.
The transaction's execution path may depend on any number of external factors and the inconvenience
of using sporadically reverting `RESTRICTED_EXECUTION_TX_TYPE` would outweigh the security benefits.

The task of preparing the Execution Restrictions largely belongs to the dApp itself.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal describes a new transaction type that should not affect the functionality of existing systems.

However, providing strict Execution Restrictions for transactions using smart contracts with multiple possible
branching execution paths will result in unpredictable reverts.

This proposal does intentionally attempt to create pressure on smart contract developers to create well-structured,
linear execution flows for their users.

## Security Considerations

### Correct Wallet UI presentation

The success of the `RESTRICTED_EXECUTION_TX_TYPE` transaction initiative lies in the wallet's ability to correctly
understand and present to the users the restrictions they are imposing on the transaction.

Wallets will need to be able to understand the meaning of the slots and operations being permitted by the transaction.
This does require wallets to be aware of all major ERC standards, such as [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md).
In many cases, this also requires the wallets to be able to fetch and analyze the source code of the executed contracts.

However, the introduction of the `execution_restrictions` parameter to transactions significantly streamlines the process
by removing the need for a deep understanding of the executed code.
Instead, only high-level information about the storage slots' meaning is required for a clear and safe representation
of possible transaction outcomes.

Note that for transactions involving operations that the wallet is not able to fully "understand",
the user will still be asked to sign on an opaque set of changes.
This is still an improvement from the "blind signing" of today by allowing an explicit ban on accessing certain balances or opcodes.

### Insufficiently Restrictive Transactions

The worst outcome of introducing a security feature is creating a false sense of security for its user.

Wallets are expected to provide the banned operations list in a way that protects their users' valuable assets.

It is critical that dApps, wallets, and users become educated about the consequences of not limiting
their transactions' execution with sufficient strictness.
