## Abstract

Although fungible tokens (FTs) are easily exchangeable across different platforms through DEX, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) do not easily migrate from one metaverse to another. The exchange of NFTs across platforms often does not promise the equivalent asset value, including quality and style. We aim to define an NFT as a single character with different visualization for multi-metaverse. An NFT character with the standard definition and predefined motion images can create an adequate visualization when entering metaverses as an NFT avatar. The NFT avatar standard will increase the utility of NFT, invigorate the metaverse industry and strengthen interoperability.

## Motivation

NFT has different utilities. Some are used as an asset in the gaming industry while some are used as a parcel of virtual land in the metaverse. The usage of NFTs has often been limited to PFP (profile picture) until today. Yet, an NFT character should be interchanged into several forms of avatars corresponding to the metaverse platform it enters. This standard distinguishes the usage between NFT characters as absolute graphical assets and NFT avatars as motion-added chameleon-ed NFT characters.

With the NFT avatar standard, NFT characters will transfer into avatars enabling use cases within multiple metaverses. The character purchased in the NFT marketplace can enter as a 2D avatar in Zep.us while it enters Another.world as a 3D avatar. In addition, user-created 3D avatars, like VR Chat, can also compatibly enter multi-metaverse as NFT avatars.

The NFT avatar standard will generate a positive value creation cycle between creators, the NFT marketplace, and the metaverse. Each individual entity will have a common standard to share, maximizing the utility and interoperability of NFTs. With the standard, the value of an item minted by creators will be increased with heightened practicality and utilization. This will boost the activity within NFT marketplaces while the usage of NFT within metaverses also increases. The versatile utility of NFT characters will increase the public desire to purchase and incentivize creators to generate, ultimately vitalizing the creator economy. Likewise, such dynamics will unleash NFT characters in the multi-metaverse.

## Specification

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY” and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Compliant contract that is extending [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) and [EIP-4955](./eip-4955.md) MUST implement `ERC721 Metadata` and in `ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema`, and it MUST add a new field `namespaces` to this JSON Schema. The data required for the avatar varies by metaverse platform. In the instance of Zep, type of asset and properties of image are defined to maximize the scalability of individual NFT.

In addition to [EIP-4955](./eip-4955.md), we define more in-depth specification to represent an avatar in various metaverses.

Here is the schema for this. This schema only defines an avatar schema for Zep.us, but it can be used for various metaverses using similar avatar representation.

## Rationale

This standard can be fully [EIP-721](./eip-721.md), [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md), [EIP-4955](./eip-4955.md) compatible by defining an "avatar" extension in the metadata. This allows developers to easily adopt the standard quickly.

## Test Cases

Here is an example of the schema.
