## Simple Summary
This EIP proposes a standard for decentralized identity management on Ethereum, enabling secure and private identity verification without centralized authorities.

## Abstract
The proposal introduces a framework for managing decentralized identities (DIDs) on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes methods for creating, updating, and verifying identities, leveraging smart contracts and cryptographic proofs to ensure privacy and security.

## Motivation
As digital interactions increase, the need for secure and private identity verification becomes critical. Current systems rely heavily on centralized authorities, which can be single points of failure and privacy concerns. This EIP aims to provide a decentralized alternative, empowering users to control their identities and data.

## Specification
- **Identity Creation**: Users can create a decentralized identity using a smart contract, which generates a unique identifier and associated cryptographic keys.
- **Identity Verification**: Third parties can verify identities through cryptographic proofs, ensuring authenticity without revealing sensitive information.
- **Identity Updates**: Users can update their identity information securely, with changes recorded on the blockchain.
- **Privacy Features**: The framework supports zero-knowledge proofs to enhance privacy, allowing users to prove identity attributes without disclosing them.
