## Abstract

This EIP introduces a new [Simple Serialize (SSZ)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md) type to represent unions with forward-compatible Merkleization: A given field is always assigned the same stable [generalized index (gindex)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/merkle-proofs.md#generalized-merkle-tree-index) across all type options.

## Motivation

Certain types, e.g., transactions, allow multiple variants carving out slightly different feature sets. Merkleization equivalence is still desirable, as it allows verifiers to check common fields across variants. These types should still efficiently deserialize into one of their possible variants corresponding to its known tree shape. In programming languages, this is typically achieved by tagged unions.

If multiple versions of an SSZ container coexist at the same time, for example to represent transaction types, the same field may be assigned to a different gindex in each version. This unnecessarily complicates verifiers and introduces a maintenance burden, as the verifier has to be kept up to date with version specific field to gindex map.

Compatible unions allow only type options to be used that provide stable gindex assignment across all of them.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174).

### `CompatibleUnion({selector: type})`

A new [SSZ composite types)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#composite-types) is defined:

- **compatible union**: union type containing one of the given subtypes with compatible Merkleization
  - notation `CompatibleUnion({selector: type})`, e.g. `CompatibleUnion({1: Square, 2: Circle})`

Compatible unions are always considered ["variable-size"](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#variable-size-and-fixed-size), even when all type options share the same fixed length.

The [default value](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#default-values) is defined as:

| Type                                | Default Value |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `CompatibleUnion({selector: type})` | n/a (error)   |

The following types are considered [illegal](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#illegal-types):

- `CompatibleUnion({})` without any type options are illegal.
- `CompatibleUnion({selector: type})` with a selector outside `uint8(1)` through `uint8(127)` are illegal.
- `CompatibleUnion({selector: type})` with a type option that has incompatible Merkleization with another type option are illegal.

#### Compatible Merkleization

- Types are compatible with themselves.
- `byte` is compatible with `uint8` and vice versa.
- `Bitlist[N]` are compatible if they share the same capacity `N`.
- `Bitvector[N]` are compatible if they share the same capacity `N`.
- `List[type, N]` are compatible if `type` is compatible and they share the same capacity `N`.
- `Vector[type, N]` are compatible if `type` is compatible and they share the same capacity `N`.
- `ProgressiveList[type]` are compatible if `type` is compatible.
- `Container` are compatible if they share the same field names in the same order, and all field types are compatible.
- `ProgressiveContainer(active_fields)` are compatible if all `1` entries in both type's `active_fields` correspond to fields with shared names and compatible types, and no other field name is shared across both types.
- `CompatibleUnion` are compatible with each other if all type options across both `CompatibleUnion` are compatible.
- All other types are incompatible.

#### Serialization

A `value` as `CompatibleUnion({selector: type})` has properties `value.data` with the contained value, and `value.selector` which indexes the selected type option.

```python
return value.selector.to_bytes(1, "little") + serialize(value.data)
```

#### Deserialization

The deserialization logic is updated:

- In the case of compatible unions, the first byte of the deserialization scope is deserialized as type selector, the remainder of the scope is deserialized as the selected type.

The following invalid input needs to be hardened against:

- An out-of-bounds type selector in a `CompatibleUnion`

#### JSON mapping

The canonical [JSON mapping](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#json-mapping) is updated:

| SSZ                                 | JSON            | Example                                |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `CompatibleUnion({selector: type})` | selector-object | `{ "selector": string, "data": type }` |

`CompatibleUnion` is encoded as an object with a `selector` and `data` field, where the contents of `data` change according to the selector.

#### Merkleization

The [SSZ Merkleization specification](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#merkleization) is extended with a helper function:

- `mix_in_selector`: Given a Merkle root `root` and a type selector `selector` (`"uint8"` serialization) return `hash(root, selector)`.

The Merkleization definitions are extended.

- `mix_in_selector(hash_tree_root(value.data), value.selector)` if `value` is of compatible union type.

## Rationale

### Why are `CompatibleUnion` selectors limited to `1 ... 127`?

Reserving `0` prevents issues with incomplete initialization, and can possibly be used in a future EIP to denote optionality.

Reserving selectors above `127` (i.e., highest bit is set) enables future backwards compatible extensions.

The range `1 ... 127` is sufficient to satisfy current demand.

### Why not field collections?

An alternative design was explored where the `active_fields` bitvector was emitted. While that works in principle, it becomes very inefficient to parse when `ProgressiveContainer` are nested, as the parser cannot immediately determine the overall tree shape. Further, the bitvector makes every single nesting layer variable-length, adding a lot of overhead to the serialized format.

With `CompatibleUnion`, a tag is emitted that tells the parser early on what to expect, including for nested fields.

Note that wrapping a field in a `CompatibleUnion` is not a backwards compatible operation. However, new options can be introduced, and existing options dropped, without breaking verifiers. Therefore, `CompatibleUnion` has to be introduced earlyon wherever future design extensions are anticipated, even when only a single type option is used.

## Backwards Compatibility

`CompatibleUnion({selector: type})` is an alternative to an [earlier union proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#composite-types). However, it has only been used in [deprecated specifications](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/specs/_deprecated/sharding/beacon-chain.md). Portal network also uses a union concept for network types, but does not use `hash_tree_root` on them, and could transition to the new compatible union proposal with a new networking version.

## Test Cases

TBD

## Reference Implementation

TBD

## Security Considerations

For `CompatibleUnion({selector: type})`, the `selector` mix-in guarantees a unique `hash_tree_root` if multiple type options refer to the same Merkle tree shape, or also if multiple type options solely differ in the element type of a `List[type, N]` or [`ProgressiveList[type]`](./eip-7916.md) field (as the `hash_tree_root` of any empty list does not depend on the `type`). Without the `selector`, such cases would either have to be defined as illegal types, or handled by the application logic (e.g., by mixing it into the signing root, or by encoding the element type into a different field).
