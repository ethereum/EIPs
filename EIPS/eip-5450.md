## Abstract

Introduce extended validation of code sections to guarantee that stack underflow cannot happen during execution of validated contracts.

## Motivation

Currently existing EVM implementations perform a number of validity checks for each executed instruction, such as check for stack overflow/underflow, sufficient gas, etc. This change aims to minimize the number of such checks required at run-time, by verifying at deploy-time that no exceptional conditions can happen, and preventing to deploy the code where it could happen.

In particular, this extended code validation eliminates the need for EVM stack underflow checks done for every executed instruction. It also prevents deploying code that can be statically proven to require more than 1024 stack items, however it may still be possible to exceed that limit in some cases, and thus overflow checks cannot be fully eliminated.

## Specification

### Code validation

*Remark:* We rely on the notions of *data stack* and *type section* as defined by [EIP-4750](./eip-4750.md).

Code section validation rules as defined by [EIP-3670](./eip-3670.md) (which has been extended by [EIP-4200](./eip-4200.md) and [EIP-4750](./eip-4750.md)) are extended again to include the instruction flow traversal procedure, where every possible code path is examined, and data stack height at each instruction is recorded. 

*Data stack height* here refers to the number of stack values accessible by this function, i.e. it does not take into account values of caller functions' frames (but does include this function's inputs). Note that validation procedure does not require actual data stack implementation, but only to keep track of its height. Current height value starts at `type[code_section_index].inputs` (number of inputs of this function) at function entry and is updated at each instruction.

At the same time the following properties are being verified:

1. For each reachable instruction in the section, data stack height is the same for all possible code paths going through this instruction.
2. For each instruction, data stack always has enough items, i.e. stack underflow is invalid.
3. For `CALLF` instruction, data stack has enough items to use as input arguments to a called function according to its type defined in the type section.
4. For `RETF` instruction, data stack before executing it has exactly `n` items to use as output values returned from a function, where `n` is function's number of outputs according to its type defined in the type section.
5. `max_stack_height` does not exceed 1023.
6. The maximum data stack height matches the corresponding code section's `max_stack_height` within the type section body.
7. No unreachable instructions exist in the code section.

To examine every reachable code path, validation needs to traverse every instruction in order, while also following each non-conditional jump, and following both possible branches for each conditional jump. After completing this, verify each instruction was visited at least once. Fail if any instructions were not visited as this invalidates 7).

The complexity of this traversal is linear in the number of instructions, because each code path is examined only once, and property 1 guarantees no loops in the validation.

### Execution

Given new deploy-time guarantees, EVM implementation is not required anymore to have run-time stack underflow check for each executed instruction.

Stack overflow check, on the other hand, is still required at run-time, because function execution can start at arbitrary (i.e. known only at run-time) stack height at `CALLF` instruction of a caller (i.e. each execution can be in arbitrary inner call frame). Verification algorithm examines only stack height changes relative to starting stack height of the function.

## Rationale

### Stack overflow check only in CALLF

In this EIP, we provide a more efficient variant of the EVM where stack overflow check is performed only in `CALLF` instruction using the called function's `max_stack_height` information. This decreases flexibility of an EVM program because `max_stack_height` corresponds to the worst-case control-flow path in the function.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change requires a “network upgrade”, since it modifies consensus rules.

It poses no risk to backwards compatibility, as it is introduced only for EOF1 contracts, for which deploying undefined instructions is not allowed, therefore there are no existing contracts using these instructions. The new instructions are not introduced for legacy bytecode (code which is not EOF formatted).

## Security Considerations

Needs discussion.
