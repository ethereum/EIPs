## Abstract

Commit to the hash tree root of each beacon chain block in the corresponding execution payload header.

Store each of these roots in a stateful precompile.

## Motivation

Roots of the beacon chain blocks are cryptographic accumulators that allow proofs of arbitrary consensus state.
Exposing these roots inside the EVM allows for trust-minimized access to the consensus layer.
This functionality supports a wide variety of use cases that improve trust assumptions of staking pools,
restaking constructions, smart contract bridges, MEV mitigations and more.

### Background

The high-level idea is that each execution block contains the parent beacon block root. Even in the event of missed slots since the previous block root does not change,
we only need a constant amount of space to represent this "oracle" in each execution block. To improve the usability of this oracle, a small history of block roots
are stored in a stateful precompile.
To bound the amount of storage this construction consumes, a ring buffer is used that mirrors a block root accumulator on the consensus layer.

### Block structure and validity

Beginning at the execution timestamp `FORK_TIMESTAMP`, execution clients **MUST**:

1. set 32 bytes of the execution block header after the `excess_data_gas` to the 32 byte [hash tree root](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/fa09d896484bbe240334fa21ffaa454bafe5842e/ssz/simple-serialize.md#merkleization) of the parent beacon block.

*NOTE*: this field is appended to the current block header structure with this EIP so that the size of the header grows after (and including) the `FORK_TIMESTAMP`.

### EVM changes

#### Block processing

At the start of processing any execution block where `block.timestamp >= FORK_TIMESTAMP` (i.e. before processing any transactions),
write the parent beacon root provided in the block header into the storage of the contract at `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS`.

This data is keyed by the slots containing the parent beacon block root which in general could be multiple slots for the
same root. To find the starting slot of the range, read the storage slot `SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT` (interpreted as a
256-bit byte array) which contains the big-endian encoding of the last slot value written to. This encoding should be interpreted
as a 64-bit big-endian integer that yields the starting slot.
Clients then iterate from the start slot (inclusive) to the end slot (exclusive) found in the header
and write the beacon block root into each slot value.

*NOTE*: if the slot stored at `SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT` is all zeros, clients should use set the start slot to one less than the
slot in the header, e.g. `header.beacon_block_root_slot - 1`.

After writing the block root in the relevant slots, store the current slot for use during the next update in the same storage slot
`SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT`.

In Python pseudocode:

```python
start_slot = to_uint64(sload(HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS, SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT))
end_slot = block_header.beacon_slot
if start_slot == 0:
    start_slot = max(end_slot - 1, 0)

parent_beacon_block_root = block_header.parent_beacon_block_root

for slot in range(start_slot, end_slot):
    sstore(HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS, slot % SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT, parent_beacon_block_root)

sstore(HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS, SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT, end_slot)
```

When using any slot value as a key to the storage, the value under consideration must be converted to 32 bytes with big-endian encoding.

#### New stateful precompile

Beginning at the execution timestamp `FORK_TIMESTAMP`, the code and storage at `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS` constitute a "stateful" precompile.

Callers of the precompile should provide the `slot` they are querying encoding a 64-bit unsigned integer as 256-bit big-endian data.
Recall this `slot` number should be reduced modulo the `SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT` constant to derive the correct key into the ring buffer structure.

Alongside the existing gas for calling the precompile, there is an additional gas cost of `G_beacon_root` cost to reflect the implicit `SLOAD` from
the precompile's state. The root is returned as 32 bytes in the caller's provided return buffer.

In pseudocode:

```python
slot = to_uint64(evm.calldata[:32])
root = sload(HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS, slot % SLOTS_PER_HISTORICAL_ROOT)
evm.returndata[:32].set(root)
```

If there is no root stored at the requested slot number, the opcode follows the existing EVM semantics of `sload` returning `0`.

## Rationale

### Gas cost of precompile

The suggested gas cost reflects a cold `SLOAD` analogous to the operation performed while executing the precompile's logic.

### Why not repurpose `BLOCKHASH`?

The `BLOCKHASH` opcode could be repurposed to provide the beacon root instead of some execution block hash.
To minimize code change, avoid breaking changes to smart contracts, and simplify deployment to mainnet, this EIP suggests leaving `BLOCKHASH` alone and adding a new opcode with the desired semantics.

### Beacon block root instead of state root

Block roots are preferred over state roots so there is a constant amount of work to do with each new execution block. Otherwise, skipped slots would require
a linear amount of work with each new payload. While skipped slots are quite rare on mainnet, it is best to not add additional load under what would already
be nonfavorable conditions.

Use of block root over state root does mean proofs will require a few additional nodes but this cost is negligible (and could be amortized across all consumers,
e.g. with a singleton state root contract that caches the proof per slot).
