## Abstract

Currently, `SWAP*` and `DUP*` instructions are limited to a stack depth of 16. Introduce three new instructions, `SWAPN`, `DUPN` and `EXCHANGE` which lift this limitation and allow accessing the stack at higher depths.

## Motivation

While the stack is 1024 items deep, easy access is only possible for the top 16 items. Supporting more local variables is possible via manually keeping them in memory or through a "stack to memory elevation" in a compiler. This can result in complex and inefficient code.

Furthermore, implementing higher level constructs, such as functions, on top of EVM will result in a list of input and output parameters as well as an instruction offset to return to.

The number of these arguments (or stack items) can easily exceed 16 and thus will require extra care from a compiler to lay them out in a way that all of them are still accessible.

Lastly, swapping items besides the 1st and Nth items in the stack is very important for compilers implementing stack scheduling algorithms (the analog of register allocation for stack machines), which try to minimize stack traffic given a set of variables and usage analysis.

Introducing `SWAPN`, `DUPN` and `EXCHANGE` will provide an option to compilers to simplify accessing deep stack items.

## Specification

We introduce three new instructions:

1. `DUPN` (`0xe6`)
2. `SWAPN` (`0xe7`)
3. `EXCHANGE` (`0xe8`)

If the code is legacy bytecode, any of these instructions result in an *exceptional halt*. (*Note: This means no change to behaviour.*)

If the code is valid EOF1, the following rules apply:

1. The instructions are followed by an 8-bit immediate value, which we call `imm`, and can have a value of 0 to 255.
   1. In the case of `DUPN` and `SWAPN`, we introduce the variable `n` which equals to `imm + 1`.
   2. In the case of `EXCHANGE`, we introduce the variable `n` which is equal to `(imm >> 4) + 1`, and the variable `m` which is equal to `(imm & 0x0F) + 1` (i.e., the first and second nibbles of `imm`, converted to one-indexing).
2. Code validation is extended to check that no relative jump instruction (`RJUMP`/`RJUMPI`/`RJUMPV`) targets immediate values of `DUPN`, `SWAPN` or `EXCHANGE`.
3. The stack validation algorithm of [EIP-5450](./eip-5450.md) is extended:
   1. Before `DUPN` if the current stack height is less than `n`, code is invalid. After `DUPN`, the stack height is incremented.
   2. Before `SWAPN` if the current stack height is less than `n + 1`, code is invalid. After `SWAPN`, the stack height is unchanged.
   3. Before `EXCHANGE` if the current stack height is less than `n + m + 1`, code is invalid. After `EXCHANGE`, the stack height is unchanged.
4. Execution rules:
   1. `DUPN`: the `n`'th stack item is duplicated at the top of the stack. (*Note: We use 1-based indexing here.*)
   2. `SWAPN`: the `n + 1`'th stack item is swapped with the top of the stack.
   3. `EXCHANGE`: the `n + 1`'th stack item is swapped with the `n + m + 1`'th stack item.

The gas cost for all three instructions is set at 3.

## Rationale

### Use of an immediate argument

Allowing dynamic selection of the arguments to swap, dup, or exchange could be used to prevent static analysis of the contents of the stack. Since static analysis is an important tool for security auditors we want to do what we can to make their jobs easier. Hence, the operands require an immediate argument that is not dynamic in nature. 

### EOF-only

Since this instruction depends on an immediate argument encoding, it can only be enabled within EOF. In legacy bytecode that encoding could contradict jumpdest-analysis.

### Size of immediate argument

For `DUPN` and `SWAPN` a 16-bit size was considered to accommodate the full stack space of 1024 items, however:

1. that would require an additional restriction/check (`n < 1024`)
2. the 256 depth is a large improvement over the current 16 and the overhead of an extra byte would make it less useful

Similarly for `EXCHANGE`, the proposed scheme allows addressing of 32 items.

### Gas cost

The gas cost for these operations is the same as for existing `DUP*` and `SWAP*` instructions, because they are just implemented as pointer swaps.

### `EXCHANGE` vs `SWAPN`

As mentioned before, `EXCHANGE` is important to compilers implementing stack scheduling algorithms. Specifically, in the case that a stack item is scheduled to be consumed deeper in the stack (for instance, the 3rd item in the stack needs to be moved into 2nd position in order to be consumed by the next operation), that currently takes three instructions, `SWAP2 SWAP3 SWAP2`. However, in the EVM implementation, the implementation is just a pointer swap, so it could be implemented in a single instruction at no extra runtime cost to the client.

## Backwards Compatibility

This has no effect on backwards compatibility because the opcodes were not previously allocated and the feature is only enabled in EOF.

## Test Cases

Given `stack[]` is a 0-based data structure, and `n`, `m` and `imm` are defined as according to the spec:

- `DUPN imm` to fail validation if `stack_height < n`.
- `SWAPN imm` to fail validation if `stack_height < n + 1`.
- `EXCHANGE imm` to fail validation if `stack_height < n + m + 1`.
- `DUPN imm` to increment maximum stack height of a function. Validation fails if maximum stack height exceeds limit of 1023.
- `DUPN imm`, `SWAPN imm`, and `EXCHANGE imm` to fail at run-time if gas available is less than 3.
- `DUPN imm` should duplicate the `stack[n - 1]` item and push it to the stack
- `SWAPN imm` should swap `stack[n]` with `stack[stack.top()]`
- `EXCHANGE imm` should swap `stack[n]` with `stack[n + m]`.

## Security Considerations

The authors are not aware of any additional risks introduced here. The EVM stack is fixed at 1024 items and most implementations keep that in memory at all times. This change will increase the number of stack items accessible via single instruction.
