## Abstract

This Meta EIP lists the EIPs considered for Glamsterdam that belong to the Gas Repricing proposal. This proposal aims to harmonize gas costs across the EVM, thus reducing the impact of single bottlenecks for scaling.

## Motivation

The main objective of the Glamsterdam fork is to improve L1 scalability. A crucial aspect of this initiative is to create a better alignment between gas costs and actual resource usage. Currently, the gas model often misprices operations, resulting in inefficiencies and unintended incentives. For instance, within the pure compute operations, there is a high variance in execution time per gas unit, which indicates that a single unit of computation is not priced equally across the various opcodes.

By standardizing gas costs across EVM operations and other resources, we can reduce bottlenecks and enhance the utilization of EVM resources, which will subsequently enable further scalability. The EIPs listed below constitute a significant first step in that direction. We expect that further iteration will be necessary in future hardforks.

## Specification

This Meta EIP includes two types of EIPs, namely, core and possible additions. This list will continue to be updated as more gas repricing EIPs are proposed.

### Core EIPs

| EIP | Description | Type |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| [EIP-7904](./eip-7904.md)| Gas Cost Repricing to reflect computational complexity and transaction throughput increase | Compute |
| [EIP-7981](./eip-7981.md)| Introduce floor pricing for access lists to reduce maximum block size. | Data |
| [EIP-7778](./eip-7778.md)| Prevent Block Gas Limit Circumvention by Excluding Refunds from Block Gas Accounting. | General Accounting |

### Possible additions

| EIP | Description | Type |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Draft [EIP-7973](./eip-7973.md)| Introduce warm account writes, decreasing the cost of writing to an account after the first write | State |
| [EIP-7976](./eip-7976.md)| Further increase calldata cost to 15/60 gas per byte to reduce maximum block size. | Data |
| [EIP-7923](./eip-7923.md)| Linearize Memory Costing and replace the current quadratic formula with a page-based cost model. | Memory |
| Draft [EIP-7971](./eip-7971.md)| Decrease costs for TLOAD, TSTORE and warm SLOAD with a transaction-global limit | Memory |
