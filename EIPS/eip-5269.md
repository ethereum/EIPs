## Abstract
An interface that returns true or false when queried by ERC numbers, if it implement certain ERC number.

## Motivation

This EIP is created as a supplement to and competing standard for against [EIP-165](./eip-165.md).

Here are the major differences between this EIP and [EIP-165](./eip-165.md).

1. [EIP-165](./eip-165.md) uses hash of method signature which basically declares the existence of method or list of methods,
therefore it requires a method to *exist* in the first place. In some case, some ERCs interface are not represented in the way
of method signature, such as some EIPs related to data format and signature schemes.
2. [EIP-165](./eip-165.md) doesn't provide query ability based on caller. This EIP respond `true` or `false` based on caller.
An example would be the OpenZeppelin has Transparency Proxy contract that behaves differently when
ProxyAdmin calls or other user calls.
3. Using ERC numbers improves human readability as well as make it easier to work with named contract such as ENS.

## Specification

1. Any compliant smart contract MUST implement the following interface

```solidity
interface IERC5269 {
  function supportsErc(uint256 majorNumber, uint256 minorNumber, address caller) external view returns (boolean isSupported);
}
```

2. `majorNumber` is the ERC number under query. `minorNumber = 0`is to reserved for the main interface.
Other `minorNumber` is reserved for the optional interface extension of that ERC.

3. Any compliant contract that is an `IERC5629` MUST return `true` for the call of `supportsErc(5269, 0, (any caller))`.

4. Any compliant standard is RECOMMENDED to declare the `minorNumber` for their optional interface extensions.

5. Any compliant contract MUST return `true` when a behavior defined in that ERC and optional interface extensions is available to a` caller`.

## Rationale

1. EIP numbers are returned in an array to reflect the practice that a smart contract usually implements more than one interface.

2. We didn't require the ordering of return value. And we only suggest but didn't require deduplication because it's cheaper to do such computation outside of chain.

3. Compared to [EIP-165](./eip-165.md), we also add an addition input of `address caller`, given the increasing popularity of proxy patterns such as those enabled by [EIP-1967](./eip-1967.md). One may ask: why not simply use `msg.sender`? This is because
we want to allow query them without transaction or a proxy contract to query if whether interface ERC-`number` will be available to
that particular sender.

4. We reserve the input `ercNumber` above 2**32 in case we need to support other collection of standards which are not ERC/EIP.

## Security Considerations
Similar to [EIP-165](./eip-165.md) callers of the interface MUST assume the smart contract
declaring they support such EIP interfaces doesn't necessarily correctly support them.
