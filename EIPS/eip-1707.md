## Simple Summary

Provide an alternative proposal compared with EIP-1702 / ECIP-1040,
with the following advantages:

* We don't need to modify existing account state format.
* We don't need to modify how precompiled contracts are invoked.
* Compatible with the standard WebAssembly binary format.

## Specification

After `FORK_BLOCK`, before an account or contract creation transaction
code is executed, check that whether:

* The first byte is `\0` (`0x00`).
* The code length is greater or equal to 4.

If so, we define the second to fourth bytes as version bits. Instead
of executing on the default EVM, pass the *whole* code array to a VM
defined by the version bits.

* If version bytes are `\0\0\1`, then invoke "EVM1", where the first 4
  bytes are stripped, and the rest of the code bytes are executed in
  an EVM with "EVM1" config.
* If version bytes are `asm`, then invoke WebAssembly virtual
  machine. This is compatible with the standard WebAssembly binary
  format because it always starts with `\0asm`.
  
If the above does not match, execute it on the default EVM. Note that
if the first byte is `\0`, the client can short circuit and stop
immediately.
