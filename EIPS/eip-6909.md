## Abstract

The following standard specifies a multi-token contract as a simplified alternative to the [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) Multi-Token Standard.

## Motivation

The ERC-1155 standard includes unnecessary features such as requiring recipient accounts with code to implement callbacks returning specific values and batch-calls in the specification. In addition, the single operator permission scheme grants unlimited allowance on every token ID in the contract. Backwards compatibility is deliberately removed only where necessary. Additional features such as batch calls, increase and decrease allowance methods, and other user experience improvements are deliberately omitted in the specification to minimize the required external interface.

According to ERC-1155, callbacks are required for each transfer and batch transfer to contract accounts. This requires potentially unnecessary external calls to the recipient when the recipient account is a contract account. While this behavior may be desirable in some cases, there is no option to opt-out of this behavior, as is the case for [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) having both `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`. In addition to runtime performance of the token contract itself, it also impacts the runtime performance and codesize of recipient contract accounts, requiring multiple callback functions and return values to recieve the tokens.

Batching transfers, while useful, are excluded from this standard to allow for opinionated batch transfer operations on different implementations. For example, a different ABI encoding may provide different benefits in different environments such as calldata size optimization for rollups with calldata storage commitments or runtime performance for environments with expensive gas fees.

A hybrid allowance-operator permission scheme enables granular yet scalable controls on token approvals. Allowances enable an external account to transfer tokens of a single token ID on a user's behalf w by their ID while operators are granted full transfer permission for all token IDs for the user.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Definitions

- infinite: The maximum value for a uint256 (`2 ** 256 - 1`).
- caller: The caller of the current context (`msg.sender`).
- spender: An account that transfers tokens on behalf of another account.
- operator: An account that has unlimited transfer permissions on all token ids for another account.
- mint: The creation of an amount of tokens. This MAY happen in a mint method or as a transfer from the zero address.
- burn: The removal an amount of tokens. This MAY happen in a burn method or as a transfer to the zero address.

### Methods

#### `totalSupply`

The total `amount` of a token `id` that exists.

MUST be equal to the sum of the `balanceOf` of all accounts of the token `id`.

```yaml
- name: totalSupply

  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: id
      type: uint256

  outputs:
    - name: amount
      type: uint256
```

#### `balanceOf`

```yaml
- name: balanceOf
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: owner
      type: address
    - name: id
      type: uint256

      type: uint256
```

#### `isOperator`

Returns `true` if the `spender` is approved as an operator for an `owner`.

```yaml
- name: isOperator
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: owner
      type: address
    - name: spender
      type: address

  outputs:
    - name: status
      type: bool
```

#### `transfer`

Transfers an `amount` of a token `id` from the caller to the `receiver`.

MUST revert when the caller's balance for the token `id` is insufficient.

MUST log the `Transfer` event.

MUST return True.

```yaml
- name: transfer
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: receiver
      type: address
    - name: id
      type: uint256
    - name: amount

  outputs:
    - name: success
      type: bool
```

#### `transferFrom`

Transfers an `amount` of a token `id` from a `sender` to a `receiver` by the caller.

MUST revert when the caller is not an operator for the `sender` and the caller's allowance for the token `id` for the `sender` is insufficient.

MUST revert when the `sender`'s balance for the token id is insufficient.

MUST log the `Transfer` event.

MUST decrease the caller's `allowance` by the same `amount` of the `sender`'s balance decrease if the caller is not an operator for the `sender` and the caller's `allowance` is not infinite.

SHOULD NOT decrease the caller's `allowance` for the token `id` for the `sender` if the `allowance` is infinite.

SHOULD NOT decrease the caller's `allowance` for the token `id` for the `sender` if the caller is an operator.

MUST return True.

```yaml

```yaml
- name: setOperator
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: spender
      type: address
    - name: approved
      type: bool

  outputs:
    - name: success
      type: bool
```

### Events

#### `Transfer`

The `caller` initiates a transfer of an `amount` of a token `id` from a `sender` to a `receiver`.

MUST be logged when an `amount` of a token `id` is transferred from one account to another.

SHOULD be logged with the `sender` address as the zero address when an `amount` of a token `id` is minted.

SHOULD be logged with the `receiver` address as the zero address when an `amount` of a token `id` is burned.

```yaml
- name: Transfer
  type: event

  inputs:
    - name: caller
      indexed: false
      type: address
    - name: sender
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: receiver
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: id
      indexed: true
      type: uint256
    - name: amount
      indexed: false
      type: uint256
```

#### `OperatorSet`

The `owner` has set the `approved` status to a `spender`.

MUST be logged when the operator status is set.

MAY be logged when the operator status is set to the same status it was before the current call.

```yaml
- name: OperatorSet
  type: event

  inputs:
    - name: owner
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: spender
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: approved
      indexed: false
      type: bool
```

#### `Approval`

The `owner` has approved a `spender` to transfer an `amount` of a token `id` to be transferred on the owner's behalf.

MUST be logged when the `allowance` is set by an `owner`.

```yaml
- name: Approval
  type: event

  inputs:
    - name: owner
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: spender
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: id
      indexed: true
      type: uint256
    - name: amount
      indexed: false
      type: uint256
```

## Rationale

### Granular Approvals

While the "operator model" from the ERC-1155 standard allows an account to set another account as an operator, giving full permissions to transfer any amount of any token id on behalf of the owner, this may not always be the desired permission scheme. The "allowance model" from [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) allows an account to set an explicit amount of the token that another account can spend on the owner's behalf. This standard requires both be implemented, with the only modification being to the "allowance model" where the token id must be specified as well. This allows an account to grant specific approvals to specific token ids, infinite approvals to specific token ids, or infinite approvals to all token ids. If an account is set as an operator, the allowance SHOULD NOT be decreased when tokens are transferred on behalf of the owner.

### Removal of Batching

While batching operations is useful, its place should not be in the standard itself, but rather on a case-by-case basis. This allows for different tradeoffs to be made in terms of calldata layout, which may be especially useful for specific applications such as roll-ups that commit calldata to global storage.

### Removal of Required Callbacks

Callbacks MAY be used within a multi-token compliant contract, but it is not required. This allows for more gas efficient methods by reducing external calls and additional checks.

### Removal of "Safe" Naming

The `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` naming conventions are misleading, especially in the context of the ERC-1155 and ERC-721 standards, as they require external calls to receiver accounts with code, passing the execution flow to an arbitrary contract, provided the receiver contract returns a specific value. The combination of removing mandatory callbacks and removing the word "safe" from all method names improves the safety of the control flow by default.

### Interface ID

The interface ID is `0xb2e69f8a`.

### Metadata Extension

#### Methods

##### name

The `name` of the contract.

```yaml
- name: name
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs: []

  outputs:
    - name: name
      type: string
```

##### symbol

The ticker `symbol` of the contract.

```yaml
- name: symbol
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs: []

  outputs:
    - name: symbol
      type: string
```

##### decimals

The `amount` of decimals for a token `id`.

```yaml
- name: decimals
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: id
      type: uint256

  outputs:
  - name: amount
    type: uint8
```

### Metadata URI Extension

#### Methods

##### tokenURI

The `URI` for a token `id`.

MAY revert if the token `id` does not exist.

MUST replace occurrences of `{id}` in the returned URI string by the client.

```yaml
- name: tokenURI
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: id
      type: uint256

  outputs:
    - name: uri
      type: string
```

#### Metadata Structure

The metadata specification closely follows that of the ERC-721 JSON schema.

MUST replace occurrences of `{id}` in the returned URI string by the client.

```json
{
  "title": "Asset Metadata",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Identifies the token"
    },
    "description": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Describes the token"
    },
    "image": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "A URI pointing to an image resource."
    }
  }
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This is not backwards compatible with ERC-1155 as some methods are removed. However, wrappers can be implemented for the ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 standards.

## Security Considerations

### Approvals and Operators

The specification includes two token transfer permission systems, the "allowance" and "operator"
models. There are two security considerations in regards to delegating permission to transfer.

The first consideration is consistent with all delegated permission models. Any account with an allowance may transfer the full allowance for any reason at any time until the allowance is revoked. Any account with operator permissions may transfer any amount of any token id on behalf of the owner until the operator permission is revoked.

The second consideration is unique to systems with both delegated permission models. In accordance with the `transferFrom` method, spenders with operator permission are not subject to allowance restrictions, spenders with infinite approvals SHOULD NOT have their allowance deducted on delegated transfers, but spenders with non-infinite approvals MUST have their balance deducted on delegated transfers. A spender with both operator permission and a non-infinite approval may introduce functional ambiguity. If the operator permission takes precedence, that is, the allowance is never deducted when a spender has operator permissions, there is no ambiguity. However, in the event the allowance takes precedence over the operator permissions, an additional branch may be necessary to ensure an allowance underflow does not occur. The following is an example of such an issue.

```solidity
contract ERC6909OperatorPrecedence {
  // -- snip --

  function transferFrom(address sender, address receiver, uint256 id, uint256 amount) public {
    // check if `isOperator` first
    if (msg.sender != sender && !isOperator[sender][msg.sender]) {
      require(allowance[sender][msg.sender][id] >= amount, "insufficient allowance");
      allowance[sender][msg.sender][id] -= amount;
    }
  
    // -- snip --
  }
}

contract ERC6909AllowancePrecedence {
  // -- snip --

  function transferFrom(address sender, address receiver, uint256 id, uint256 amount) public {
    // check if allowance is sufficient first
    if (msg.sender != sender && allowance[sender][msg.sender][id] < amount) {
      require(isOperator[sender][msg.sender], "insufficient allowance");
    }

    // ERROR: when allowance is insufficient, this panics due to arithmetic underflow, regardless of
    // whether the caller has operator permissions.
    allowance[sender][msg.sender][id] -= amount;

    // -- snip
  }
}
```
