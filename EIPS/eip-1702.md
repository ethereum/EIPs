## Simple Summary

Introduce account versioning for smart contracts so upgrading the VM
or introducing new VMs can be easier.

## Abstract

This defines a method of hard forking while maintaining the exact
functionality of existing account by allowing multiple versions of the
virtual machines to execute in the same block. This is also useful to
define future account state structures when we introduce the on-chain
WebAssembly virtual machine.

## Motivation

By allowing account versioning, we can execute different virtual
machine for contracts created at different times. This allows breaking
features to be implemented while making sure existing contracts work
as expected.

Note that this specification might not apply to all hard forks. We
have emergency hard forks in the past due to network attacks. Whether
they should maintain existing account compatibility should be
evaluated in individual basis. If the attack can only be executed once
against some particular contracts, then the scheme defined here might
still be applicable. Otherwise, having a plain emergency hard fork
might still be a good idea.

## Specification

### Account State

Re-define account state stored in the world state trie to have 5
items: `nonce`, `balance`, `storageRoot`, `codeHash`, and
`version`. The newly added field `version` is a 256-bit integer. When
`version` is zero, the account is RLP-encoded with the first 4
items. When `version` is not zero, the account is RLP-encoded with 5
items.

### Contract Deployment

In Ethereum, a contract has a deployment method, either by a contract
creation transaction, or by another contract. If we regard this
deployment method a contract's *parent*, then we find them forming a
family of contracts, with the *root* being a contract creation
transaction.

We let a family of contracts to always have the same `version`. That
is, `CREATE` and `CREATE2` will always deploy contract that has the
same `version` as the calling `address`.

#### Alternative Design

This provides an alternative design that allows `CREATE`, `CREATE2`
and contract creation transaction to deploy contract whose version are
different.

The client maintains a mapping `V` of currently supported version
prefix (for example, `\0asm`) to `version` number. All version
prefixes have the invariant that given any prefix in mapping `a` and
`b`, `a` is not `b`'s prefix. Version numbers in `V` cannot be zero.

Apply the following cause on contract deployment for all `CREATE`,
`CREATE2` and contract deployment transaction.

* If the `version` of caller (determined by `I_a`) is zero, then
  `CREATE` and `CREATE2` will always deploy contract with version zero.
* If the `version` of caller (determined by `I_a`) is not zero, do the
  following checks and operations, and return out-of-gas if any of it
  fails:
  * Check that the code starts with an prefix in `V`, with `version`
    number.
  * Use `version`'s validation procedure to validate the *whole* code
    (with prefix).
  * Deploy the contract with `version`.

### Validation

A new phrase, *validation* is added to contract deployment (by
`CREATE` / `CREATE2` opcodes, or by contract creation
transaction). When `version` is `0`, the phrase does nothing and
always succeeds. Future VM versions can define additional validation
that has to be passed.

If the validation phrase fails, deployment does not proceed and return
out-of-gas.

### Contract Execution

VM version used in contract execution is determined via calling
`address` (`I_a` in yellow paper).

### Contract Creation Transaction

Define `LATEST_VERSION` in a hard fork to be the latest supported VM
version. A contract creation transaction is always executed in
`LATEST_VERSION`. Before a contract creation transaction is executed,
run *validation* on the contract creation code. If it does not pass,
return out-of-gas.

#### Alternative Design

This provides an alternative design that allows contract to be created
in multiple versions.

Add an additional field `version` (256-bit integer) in contract
creation transaction. So it becomes `nonce`, `gasprice`, `startgas`,
`to`, `value`, `data`, `v`, `r`, `s`, `version`. When signing or
recovering, sign ten items, with `v`, `r`, `s` as defined by EIP-155.

The transaction would be executed in `version` supplied. If `version`
is not supported or *validation* does not pass, return out-of-gas.

### Precompiled Contract and Externally-owned Address

Precompiled contracts and externally-owned addresses do not have
`version`. If a message-call transaction or `CALL` / `CALLCODE` /
`STATICCALL` / `DELEGATECALL` touches a new externally-owned address
or a non-existing precompiled contract address, it is always created
with `version` field being `0`.

## Rationale

This introduces account versioning via a new RLP item in account
state. The first design above gets account versioning by making the
contract *family* always have the same version. In this way, versions
are only needed to be provided by contract creation transaction, and
there is no restrictions on formats of code for any version. If we
want to support multiple newest VMs (for example, EVM and WebAssembly
running together), then this requires alternative design in contract
creation transaction section

The second design above requires new versions of VMs follow a
formatting -- that it always has a prefix. In this way, the version
can be derived from the prefix, thus allowing a contract *family* to
have multiple versions. It also makes it so that we can pin contract
creation transaction using only one VM version, and it can deploy
other VM versions.

Alternatively, account versioning can also be done through:

* **EIP-1707** and **EIP-1712**: This makes an account's versioning
  soly dependent on its code header prefix. If with only EIP-1707, it
  is not possible to certify any code is valid, because current VM
  allows treating code as data. This can be fixed by EIP-1712, but the
  drawback is that it's potentially backward incompatible.
* **EIP-1891**: Instead of writing version field into account RLP
  state, we write it in a separate contract. This can accomplish the
  same thing as this EIP and potentially reduces code complexity, but
  the drawback is that every code execution will require an additional
  trie traversal, which impacts performance.

## Backwards Compatibility

Account versioning is fully backwards compatible, and it does not
change how current contracts are executed.

## Discussions

### Performance

Currently nearly all full node implementations uses config parameters
to decide which virtual machine version to use. Switching vitual
machine version is simply an operation that changes a pointer using a
different set of config parameters. As a result, this scheme has
nearly zero impact to performance.

### WebAssembly

This scheme can also be helpful when we deploy on-chain WebAssembly
virtual machine. In that case, WASM contracts and EVM contracts can
co-exist and the execution boundary and interaction model are clearly
defined as above.

## Test Cases and Implementations

To be added.
