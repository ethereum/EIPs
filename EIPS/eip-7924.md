## Abstract

This EIP introduces a standardized URI format for representing and triggering Ethereum JSON-RPC requests, allowing users to execute blockchain actions directly via URLs or QR codes. It extends the existing `ethereum:` URI scheme by supporting full RPC methods, optional chain identifiers, and additional semantic metadata such as `intent`, enhancing Web3 UX and interoperability across wallets.

## Motivation

EIP-681 introduced a way to encode Ethereum payment requests via URIs, laying the foundation for user-friendly interactions such as QR-code based payments. However, its scope is limited to eth_sendTransaction and lacks flexibility for more complex interactions, such as multi-call sequences, RPC methods beyond simple transfers, and chain-specific contexts.

As the ecosystem matures, users are increasingly performing a variety of Web3 actions—depositing into vaults, interacting with smart contracts, switching chains, or batch-signing transactions—all of which are not easily represented within the current URI standard.

This proposal aims to extend the URI pattern introduced in EIP-681 to support:

Arbitrary RPC calls (e.g., wallet_addEthereumChain, eth_call, eth_signTypedData)

Chained or multi-step requests via base64-encoded payloads

A clear and consistent way to encode the target chain (via chainId)

A more versatile way to encode intent (e.g., "deposit", "swap", "vote", etc.)

Seamless QR-based user interactions without requiring wallet connection or dapp session

By standardizing this flexible URI format, wallets can parse and act on requests directly from a link or QR code, enabling smoother real-world interactions and improving onboarding, security, and UX across Ethereum applications.

## Specification

The URI format extends the current `ethereum:` scheme:

`ethereum:<rpc_method>[:<chain_id>]?[<key>=<value>&...]`

### Required components

- `rpc_method`: any valid Ethereum JSON-RPC method supported by the wallet (e.g. `eth_sendTransaction`, `wallet_addEthereumChain`, etc.)
- `chain_id`: optional chain identifier (e.g. `1` for Ethereum Mainnet, `324` for ZkSync Era)
- URL parameters: key-value pairs representing the parameters of the RPC method

### Optional components

- `requests_b64`: for `multi-request`, a base64-encoded array of RPC calls

### Example URIs

**eth_sendTransaction**

```
ethereum:eth_sendTransaction:324?from=0x8082da67710c14e7f668efc73ac27ad6b2d7cafe&to=0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238&gas=0x76c0&gasPrice=0x4a817c800&value=0x0&data=0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000ffce4d191cb5007ee9ad7226581f7e217b68cafe00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f4240636166656369746f
```

**wallet_addEthereumChain**

```
ethereum:wallet_addEthereumChain?intent=addChain&chainId=0x64&rpcUrls=https%3A%2F%2Frpc.gnosischain.com&symbol=XDAI
```

**multi-request**

```
ethereum:multi_request:324?requests_b64=W3sibWV0aG9kIjoid2FsbGV0X3N3aXRjaEV0aGVyZXVtQ2hhaW4iLCJwYXJhbXMiOlt7ImNoYWluSWQiOiIweDE0NCJ9XX0seyJtZXRob2QiOiJldGhfc2VuZFRyYW5zYWN0aW9uIiwicGFyYW1zIjpbeyJmcm9tIjoiMHg4MDgyZGE2NzcxMGMxNGU3ZjY2OGVmYzczYWMyN2FkNmIyZDdjYWZlIiwidG8iOiIweDFjN0Q0QjE5NkNiMEM3QjAxZDc0M0ZiYzYxMTZhOTAyMzc5QzcyMzgiLCJnYXMiOiIweDc2YzAiLCJnYXNQcmljZSI6IjB4NGE4MTdjODAwIiwidmFsdWUiOiIweDAiLCJkYXRhIjoiMHhhOTA1OWNiYjAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDBmZmNlNGQxOTFjYjUwMDdlZTlhZDcyMjY1ODFmN2UyMTdiNjhjYWZlMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwZjQyNDA2MzYxNmY2NjYzNjk3In1dfV0=
```

## Rationale

- **Intents** allow wallet interfaces to preemptively guide users through transactions with clear context.
- **Chain-specific targeting** improves safety and predictability across networks.
- **Multi-request** support allows for batch operations, simplifying advanced workflows (e.g., approval + vault deposit).
- **QR-friendly design** enables real-world usage (e.g., payments, POS, offline signing).

Alternate designs such as JSON files or app links introduce complexity and dependency on frontend apps, while EI-URI stays fully compatible with existing URI schemes and QR infrastructure.

## Backwards Compatibility

The proposed format extends the existing `ethereum:` URI standard but remains backward-compatible. Wallets that do not support the extended format will simply ignore unknown parameters.

## Test Cases

TBD – Will include example URIs and expected behavior in compatible wallets.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation could be built as a lightweight URI parser in JavaScript that extracts and maps the URL to a `window.ethereum.request(...)` call.

## Security Considerations

Wallets MUST validate all parameters before executing actions. Special care must be taken with `multi-request`, base64 decoding, and default values like `gas` or `value` to avoid exploits or phishing vectors.
