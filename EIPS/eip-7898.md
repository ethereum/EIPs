## Abstract

Currently, the beacon block in Ethereum Consensus embed transactions within `ExecutionPayload` field of `BeaconBlockBody`. This EIP proposes to replace `ExecutionPayload` with `ExecutionPayloadHeader` in `BeaconBlockBody` and to independently transmit `ExecutionPayloadWithInclusionProof`.

However, this EIP makes no change to the block import mechanism, with the exception that block availability now includes waiting for the availability of `ExecutionPayloadWithInclusionProof`, making it different and simpler from proposals like ePBS/APS.

But this availability requirement can infact be restricted to `gossip` import while allowing optimistic syncing of the execution layer (EL) on checkpoint/range sync as EL can pull full blocks from their peers in optimistic sync as they do now.

## Motivation

Ethereum protocol has an ambitious goal to grow the `gasLimit` of the execution payloads (possibly by 10X). This leads to larger messages, negatively affecting the networking and block processing pipelines of the consensus layer (CL) clients leading to following issues:

1. Higher latencies for the arrival of beacon blocks increase, requiring larger bandwidth resources to be made available for the beacon node.
2. The greater number and size of transactions directly increase the merkelization compute time, increasing the import time of the block.

We know from timing games that the block import latency greatly affects a client's performance to make correct head attestations. With this EIP, block transmission and block import processes will be decongested, allowing for greater flexibility in receiving a larger `ExecutionPayloadWithInclusionProof`, while the beacon block can simultaneously undergo processing. 

In addition, EL clients can also independently participate in forwarding and receiving larger execution blocks. That mechanism however can be independently developed and is out of scope for this EIP.

Additional benefits obtained from this EIP:

- Consensus clients don't need to store and serve blocks with transactions, providing greater efficiency and reduced resource requirements for running a beacon node.
- The proposer-builder separation (PBS) pipeline becomes more efficient by the proposer transmitting the signed block directly to the p2p network, while submitting to the builder/relay for the independent reveal of the `ExecutionPayloadWithInclusionProof`.
- In the future with zero-knowledge (ZK) proof of the EL block execution, nodes could treat the transactions similarly to blobs which leverage data availability sampling (DAS) mechanisms for available data without requiring re-execution of transactions to establish validity. Hence the L1 execution could itself become a rollup by alleviating the need to import all transaction data by a node.

Furthermore CL clients apis and code path will become cleaner and more maintainable because of collapse of blinded and full versions (like `BlindedBeaconBlock`, `BlindedBeaconBlockBody`) into same types.

## Specification

- `ExecutionPayload` in the `BeaconBlockBody` is replaced by `ExecutionPayloadHeader`
- `ExecutionPayloadWithInclusionProof` is computed by the block proposer/builder and gossiped independently on a separate new topic. Also builder `submitBlindedBlock` api is modified to respond with `ExecutionPayloadWithInclusionProof` instead.
- Data availability checks for block import into forkchoice now must wait for availability of the corresponding `ExecutionPayloadWithInclusionProof` but only for gossiped blocks
- `newPayloadHeader` engine api is introduced to augument the previous usage of `newPayload` in block processing when `ExecutionPayload` is not available for e.g. in processing range synced blocks signalling EL clients to optimistic sync those payloads from EL p2p network.

ELs can optionally introduce a `getExecutionPayload` method (similar to `getBlobs`) to assist with faster recovery of execution payload from the EL's p2p network peers who could annouce new payload hashes when they see new `VALID` payloads. However, as noted above, that mechanism could be independently specified and is out of scope for this EIP.

## Rationale

There is another choice we could have made to go for `SignedExecutionPayload` instead of `ExecutionPayloadWithInclusionProof` and having a `SignedExecutionPayloadHeader` with builder signing these messages (validator is the builder in local block building). But without builder enshrinment tight gossip validation of `SignedExecutionPayload` would be an issue and could become a DOS vector.

The benefit of `SignedExecutionPayload` design is that it could be transmitted ahead of even the `SignedExecutionPayloadHeader` inclusion in beacon block and is especially usedful in PBS pipeline where the proposal to builder/relay latency can be reduced significantly.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change isn't backward compatible and a new hardfork is required to activate this EIP.
