## Abstract

This EIP introduces Block-Level Access Lists (BALs) that record all accounts and storage locations accessed during block execution, along with their post-execution values. BALs enable parallel disk reads, parallel transaction validation, and executionless state updates.

## Motivation

Transaction execution cannot be parallelized without knowing in advance which addresses and storage slots will be accessed. While [EIP-2930](./eip-2930.md) introduced optional transaction access lists, they are not enforced.

This proposal enforces access lists at the block level, enabling:

- Parallel disk reads and transaction execution
- State reconstruction without executing transactions
- Reduced execution time to `parallel IO + parallel EVM`

## Specification

### Block Structure Modification

We introduce a new field to the block header:

```python
class Header:
    # Existing fields
    ...
    
    block_access_list_hash: Hash32
```

The block body includes a `BlockAccessList` containing all account accesses and state changes.

### SSZ Data Structures

BALs use SSZ encoding following the pattern: `address -> field -> tx_index -> change`.

```python
# Type aliases using SSZ types
Address = Bytes20  # 20-byte Ethereum address
StorageKey = Bytes32  # 32-byte storage slot key  
StorageValue = Bytes32  # 32-byte storage value
CodeData = List[byte, MAX_CODE_SIZE]  # Variable-length contract bytecode
TxIndex = uint16  # Transaction index within block (max 65,535)
Balance = uint128  # Post-transaction balance in wei (16 bytes, sufficient for total ETH supply)
Nonce = uint64  # Account nonce

# Constants; chosen to support a 630m block gas limit
MAX_TXS = 30_000
MAX_SLOTS = 300_000
MAX_ACCOUNTS = 300_000
MAX_CODE_SIZE = 24_576  # Maximum contract bytecode size in bytes
MAX_CODE_CHANGES = 1

# Core change structures (no redundant keys)
class StorageChange(Container):
    """Single storage write: tx_index -> new_value"""
    tx_index: TxIndex
    new_value: StorageValue

class BalanceChange(Container):
    """Single balance change: tx_index -> post_balance"""
    tx_index: TxIndex
    post_balance: Balance

class NonceChange(Container):
    """Single nonce change: tx_index -> new_nonce"""
    tx_index: TxIndex
    new_nonce: Nonce

class CodeChange(Container):
    """Single code change: tx_index -> new_code"""
    tx_index: TxIndex
    new_code: CodeData

# Slot-level mapping (eliminates slot key redundancy)
class SlotChanges(Container):
    """All changes to a single storage slot"""
    slot: StorageKey
    changes: List[StorageChange, MAX_TXS]  # Only changes, no redundant slot

# Account-level mapping (groups all account changes)
class AccountChanges(Container):
    """
    All changes for a single account, grouped by field type.
    This eliminates address redundancy across different change types.
    """
    address: Address
    
    # Storage changes (slot -> [tx_index -> new_value])
    storage_changes: List[SlotChanges, MAX_SLOTS]
    
    # Read-only storage keys
    storage_reads: List[StorageKey, MAX_SLOTS]
    
    # Balance changes ([tx_index -> post_balance])
    balance_changes: List[BalanceChange, MAX_TXS]
    
    # Nonce changes ([tx_index -> new_nonce])
    nonce_changes: List[NonceChange, MAX_TXS]
    
    # Code changes ([tx_index -> new_code])
    code_changes: List[CodeChange, MAX_CODE_CHANGES]

# Block-level structure
class BlockAccessList(Container):
    """
    Block Access List
    """
    account_changes: List[AccountChanges, MAX_ACCOUNTS]
```

The `BlockAccessList` contains all addresses accessed during block execution:

- Addresses with state changes (storage, balance, nonce, or code)
- Addresses accessed without state changes (e.g., `STATICCALL` targets, `BALANCE` opcode targets)

Addresses with no state changes MUST still be included with empty change lists.

Ordering requirements:

- Addresses: lexicographic (bytewise)
- Storage keys: lexicographic within each account
- Transaction indices: ascending within each change list

Storage writes include:

- Value changes (different post-value than pre-value)
- Zeroed slots (pre-value exists, post-value is zero)

Storage reads:

- Slots accessed via `SLOAD` but not written
- Slots written with unchanged values (`SSTORE` with same value)

Entries in an [EIP-2930](./eip-2930.md) access list MUST not automatically be included in the `block_access_list` - only addresses and storage slots that are actually touched or changed during execution are recorded.

Balance changes record post-transaction balances (`uint128`) for:

- Transaction senders (gas + value)
- Transaction recipients (value with `value > 0`)
- Coinbase (rewards + fees)
- SELFDESTRUCT/SENDALL beneficiaries
- Withdrawal recipients (system withdrawals, [EIP-4895](./eip-4895.md))


Zero-value transfers: MUST NOT be recorded in `balance_changes` but addresses MUST be included with empty `AccountChanges`.

Code changes track post-transaction runtime bytecode for deployed/modified contracts and delegation indicators from [EIP-7702](./eip-7702.md).

Nonce changes record post-transaction nonces for EOA senders, contracts that performed a successful `CREATE` or `CREATE2` operation, deployed contracts and [EIP-7702](./eip-7792.md) authorities.

### Important Implementation Details

#### Edge Cases

- **SELFDESTRUCT/SENDALL**: Beneficiary recorded as balance change
- **Accessed but unchanged**: Include with empty changes (`EXTCODEHASH`, `EXTCODESIZE`, `BALANCE`, `STATICCALL`, etc. targets)
- **Zero-value transfers**: Include address, omit from balance_changes
- **Gas refunds**: Final balance of sender recorded after each transactions
- **Block rewards**: Final balance of fee recipient recorded after each transactions
- **Exceptional halts**: Final nonce and balance of sender and balance of fee recipient recorded after each transactions
- **Consensus layer withdrawals (EIP-4895)**: Recipients recorded with final balance after withdrawal
- **Pre-execution system contract calls**: All state changes MUST use `tx_index = len(transactions)`
- **Post-execution system contract calls**: All state changes MUST use `tx_index = len(transactions) +1`
- **EIP-2935 block hash**: System contract storage diffs of the single updated storage slot in the ring buffer
- **EIP-4788 beacon root**: System contract storage diffs of the two updated storage slots the ring buffer
- **EIP-7002 withdrawals**: System contract storage diffs of the storage slots 0-3 (4 slots) after dequeuing call
- **EIP-7251 consolidations**: System contract storage diffs of the storage slots 0-3 (4 slots) after dequeuing call

### Concrete Example

Example block:

**Pre-execution:**

- EIP-2935: Store parent hash at block hash contract (0x0000...0001)
- EIP-7002: Omitted for simplicity.

**Transactions:**

1. Alice (0xaaaa...) sends 1 ETH to Bob (0xbbbb...), checks balance of 0x2222...
2. Charlie (0xcccc...) calls factory (0xffff...) deploying contract at 0xdddd...

**Post-execution:**

- Withdrawal of 100 ETH to Eve (0xabcd...)
- EIP-7002 and EIP-7251 omitted for simplicity.

Note: Pre-execution system contract uses tx_index = 2 (len(transactions))
      Post-execution withdrawal uses tx_index = 3 (len(transactions) + 1)

### State Transition Function

Modify the state transition function to validate the block-level access lists:

```python 
def validate_bal(block):
    # Collect all state accesses and changes during block execution
    collected_accesses = {}
    
    # Process pre-execution system contracts (parent hashes, beacon roots)

    process_system_contracts_pre(block, collected_accesses, pre_exec_tx_index)
    
    # Execute transactions and track all state accesses
    for tx_index, tx in enumerate(block.transactions):
        execute_and_track(tx, tx_index, collected_accesses)
    
    # Process withdrawals after all transactions

```

The BAL MUST be complete and accurate. Missing or spurious entries invalidate the block.

Clients MUST validate by comparing execution-gathered accesses (per [EIP-2929](./eip-2929.md)) with the BAL.

Clients MAY invalidate immediately if any transaction exceeds declared state.

## Rationale

### BAL Design Choice

This design variant was chosen for several key reasons:

1. **Size vs parallelization**: BALs include all accessed addresses (even unchanged) for complete parallel execution. Omitting read values reduces size while maintaining parallelization benefits.

2. **Storage values for writes**: Post-execution values enable state reconstruction during sync without individual proofs against state root.

3. **Overhead analysis**: Historical data shows ~40 KiB average BAL size.

4. **Transaction independence**: 60-80% of transactions access disjoint storage slots, enabling effective parallelization.

5. **SSZ encoding**: Enables efficient Merkle proofs for light clients. SSZ BAL embedded as opaque bytes in RLP block for compatibility.

### Block Size Considerations

Block size impact (historical analysis):

- Average: ~40 KiB (compressed)
- Balance diffs: ~4.5 KiB (compressed)
- Storage diffs: ~33.88 KiB (compressed)
- Nonce diffs: ~0.02 KiB (compressed)
- Code diffs: ~0.6 KiB (compressed)
- Worst-case (36m gas): ~0.93 MiB
- Worst-case balance diffs: ~0.12 MiB

Smaller than current worst-case calldata blocks.

An empirical analysis has been done [here](../assets/eip-7928/bal_size_analysis.md).

### Asynchronous Validation

BAL verification occurs alongside parallel IO and EVM operations without delaying block processing.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal requires changes to the block structure that are not backwards compatible and require a hard fork.

## Security Considerations

### Validation Overhead

Validating access lists and balance diffs adds validation overhead but is essential to prevent acceptance of invalid blocks.

### Block Size

Increased block size impacts propagation but overhead (~40 KiB average) is reasonable for performance gains.
