## Abstract

This EIP introduces Block-Level Access Lists (BALs), which provide a comprehensive record of all storage locations accessed during a block, along with the corresponding modifications and their impact on the state. By making this information explicit, BALs enable parallel disk reads, parallel transaction validation, and executionless state updates. These capabilities improve execution efficiency and accelerate block validation, potentially allowing for higher gas limits in the future and laying important groundwork for zkEVM full nodes.

## Motivation

Currently, transactions without an explicit transaction access list cannot be efficiently parallelized, as the execution engine cannot determine in advance which addresses and storage slots will be accessed. While transaction-level access lists exist via [EIP-2930](./eip-2930.md), they are not enforced, making it difficult to optimize execution pipelines.

We propose enforcing access lists at the block level and shifting the responsibility of their creation to the block builder. This enables to efficiently parallelize both disk reads and transaction execution, knowing in advance the exact scope of storage interactions for each transaction.

The inclusion of post-execution values for writes in BALs provides an additional benefit for state syncing. Nodes can use these values to reconstruct state without processing all transactions, verifying correctness by comparing the derived state root to the head block's state root.

BALs map transactions to `(address, storage key, value)` tuples and include balance, code and nonce diffs. This approach facilitates parallel disk reads and parallel execution, reducing maximum execution time to `parallel IO + parallel EVM` and improving overall network performance.

## Specification

### Block Structure Modification

We introduce a new field to the block header:

```python
class Header:
    # Existing fields
    ...
    
    bal_hash: Hash32
```

We introduce three new components in the block body:

1. A Block Access List (BAL) that maps transactions to accessed storage locations and post-execution values for writes.
2. Balance Diffs that track every address touched by value transfers along with the balance deltas.
3. Code Diffs that track every address and the deployed code to it.
4. Nonce Diffs that record the post-transaction nonces of accounts which invoke `CREATE` or `CREATE2`.

### SSZ Data Structures

```python
# Type aliases
Address = ByteVector(20)
StorageKey = ByteVector(32)
StorageValue = ByteVector(32)
CodeData = ByteList(MAX_CODE_SIZE)
TxIndex = uint16
BalanceDelta = ByteVector(12)  # signed, two's complement encoding
Nonce = uint64

# Constants; chosen to support a 630m block gas limit
MAX_TXS = 30_000
MAX_SLOTS = 300_000
MAX_ACCOUNTS = 300_000
MAX_CODE_SIZE = 24_576  # Maximum contract bytecode size in bytes

# Change structures
class StorageChange(Container):
    tx_index: TxIndex
    new_value: StorageValue

class BalanceChange(Container):
    tx_index: TxIndex
    delta: BalanceDelta

class NonceChange(Container):
    tx_index: TxIndex
    new_nonce: Nonce

class CodeChange(Container):
    tx_index: TxIndex
    new_code: CodeData

# Storage access structures
class SlotChanges(Container):
    slot: StorageKey
    changes: List[StorageChange, MAX_TXS]

class SlotRead(Container):
    slot: StorageKey

# Account-level structure
class AccountChanges(Container):
    address: Address
    storage_changes: List[SlotChanges, MAX_SLOTS]
    storage_reads: List[SlotRead, MAX_SLOTS]
    balance_changes: List[BalanceChange, MAX_TXS]
    nonce_changes: List[NonceChange, MAX_TXS]
    code_changes: List[CodeChange, MAX_TXS]

# Block-level structure
class BlockAccessList(Container):
    account_changes: List[AccountChanges, MAX_ACCOUNTS]
```

#### Structure Requirements

The `BlockAccessList` groups all changes for each account together in a single `AccountChanges` structure.

**Ordering Requirements:**
- Accounts in `account_changes` MUST be ordered lexicographically by address
- Storage slots within each account MUST be ordered lexicographically by slot key
- Transaction indices within each change list MUST be ordered in ascending order

**Storage Access:**
- For writes, each `SlotChanges` MUST contain the storage slot and an ordered list of `StorageChange` entries with transaction indices and final values
- For reads, each `SlotRead` MUST contain only the storage slot (no changes)
- Transactions with writes that do not change the storage value MUST NOT be included

**Balance Changes:**
- The `balance_changes` field tracks every balance change for the account, including transaction senders, recipients, and coinbase
- Each `BalanceChange` MUST include the transaction index and signed balance delta
- 12 bytes are sufficient to represent the total ETH supply using two's complement encoding

**Code Changes:**
- The `code_changes` field tracks contract deployments with post-transaction runtime bytecode
- Each `CodeChange` MUST include the transaction index and complete contract bytecode
- Typically contains 0 or 1 entry per account

**Nonce Changes:**
- The `nonce_changes` field records post-transaction nonce values for accounts whose nonces increased due to successful `CREATE`/`CREATE2` invocations
- Each `NonceChange` MUST include the transaction index and the nonce value after execution

### State Transition Function

Modify the state transition function to validate the block-level access lists:

```python 
def state_transition(block):
    # Track all account changes
    account_changes = {}  # address -> account data
    
    def ensure_account(address):
        """Ensure account exists in tracking structure"""
        if address not in account_changes:
            account_changes[address] = {
                'storage_writes': {},  # slot -> [(tx_index, value)]
                'storage_reads': set(),  # {slot}
                'balance_changes': [],  # [(tx_index, delta)]
                'nonce_changes': [],   # [(tx_index, nonce)]
                'code_changes': []     # [(tx_index, code)]
            }

    for tx_index, tx in enumerate(block.transactions):
        # Execute transaction and collect state accesses and changes
        accessed, balance_changes, code_changes, nonce_changes = execute_transaction(tx)

        # Process storage accesses
        for (addr, slot, is_write, value) in accessed:
            ensure_account(addr)
            
            if is_write:
                if slot not in account_changes[addr]['storage_writes']:
                    account_changes[addr]['storage_writes'][slot] = []
                account_changes[addr]['storage_writes'][slot].append((tx_index, value))
            else:
                account_changes[addr]['storage_reads'].add(slot)

        # Process balance changes
        for (addr, delta) in balance_changes:
            ensure_account(addr)
            account_changes[addr]['balance_changes'].append((tx_index, delta))

        # Process code changes
        for (addr, code) in code_changes:
            ensure_account(addr)
            account_changes[addr]['code_changes'].append((tx_index, code))

        # Process nonce changes
        for (addr, nonce) in nonce_changes:
            ensure_account(addr)
            account_changes[addr]['nonce_changes'].append((tx_index, nonce))

    # Build the final BlockAccessList structure
    computed_bal = build_block_access_list(account_changes)
    
    # Validate that the provided BAL matches the computed one
    assert block.access_list == computed_bal

def build_block_access_list(account_changes):
    """Convert tracked changes into BlockAccessList structure"""
    account_list = []
    
    # Process each account's changes
    for address in sorted(account_changes.keys()):
        changes = account_changes[address]
        
        # Build storage changes (writes)
        storage_changes = []
        for slot in sorted(changes['storage_writes'].keys()):
            slot_writes = sorted(changes['storage_writes'][slot])
            storage_change_list = [
                StorageChange(tx_index=tx_idx, new_value=value) 
                for tx_idx, value in slot_writes
            ]
            storage_changes.append(SlotChanges(slot=slot, changes=storage_change_list))
        
        # Build storage reads (exclude slots that were written to)
        storage_reads = []
        written_slots = set(changes['storage_writes'].keys())
        for slot in sorted(changes['storage_reads'] - written_slots):
            storage_reads.append(SlotRead(slot=slot))
        
        # Build other change types
        balance_changes = [
            BalanceChange(tx_index=tx_idx, delta=delta)
            for tx_idx, delta in sorted(changes['balance_changes'])
        ]
        
        nonce_changes = [
            NonceChange(tx_index=tx_idx, new_nonce=nonce)
            for tx_idx, nonce in sorted(changes['nonce_changes'])
        ]
        
        code_changes = [
            CodeChange(tx_index=tx_idx, new_code=code)
            for tx_idx, code in sorted(changes['code_changes'])
        ]
        
        # Create account changes entry
        account_entry = AccountChanges(
            address=address,
            storage_changes=storage_changes,
            storage_reads=storage_reads,
            balance_changes=balance_changes,
            nonce_changes=nonce_changes,
            code_changes=code_changes
        )
        
        account_list.append(account_entry)
    
    return BlockAccessList(account_changes=account_list)
```

The BAL MUST be complete and accurate. It MUST NOT contain too few entries (missing accesses) or too many entries (spurious accesses). Any missing or extra entries in the access list, balance diffs, or nonce diffs MUST result in block invalidation.

Client implementations MUST compare the accessed addresses and storage keys gathered during execution (as defined in [EIP-2929](./eip-2929.md)) with those included in the BAL to determine validity.

Client implementations MAY invalidate the block right away in case any transaction steps outside the declared state.

## Rationale

### BAL Design Choice

This design variant was chosen for several key reasons:

1. **Balance between size and parallelization benefits**: BALs enable both parallel disk reads and parallel EVM execution while maintaining manageable block sizes. Since worst-case block sizes for reads are larger than for writes, omitting read values from the BAL significantly reduces its size. This approach still allows parallelization of both IO and EVM execution. While including read values would further enable parallelization between IO and EVM operations, analysis of historical data suggests that excluding them strikes a better balance between worst-case block sizes and overall efficiency.

2. **Storage value inclusion for writes**: Including post-execution values for write operations facilitates state reconstruction during syncing, enabling faster chain catch-up. Unlike snap sync, state updates in BALs are not individually proved against the state root. Similar to snap sync, execution itself is not proven. However, validators can verify correctness by comparing the final state root with the one received from a light node for the head block.

3. **Balance and nonce tracking**: Balance diffs and nonce tracking are crucial for correct handling of parallel transaction execution. While most nonce updates can be anticipated statically (based on sender accounts), contract creation operations (`CREATE` and `CREATE2`) can increase an account's nonce without that account appearing as a sender. The nonce diff structure specifically addresses this edge case by tracking nonces for contract deployers and deployed contracts. For changing delegation under [EIP-7702](./eip-7702.md), the transaction type indicates that an `authority`'s nonce must be updated.

4. **Reasonable overhead with significant benefits**: Analysis of historical blocks (random sample of 1000 blocks between 22,195,599 and 22,236,441) shows that BALs would have had an average size of around 40 KiB, with balance diffs adding only 9.6 KiB on average. This represents a reasonable overhead given the substantial performance benefits in block validation time.

5. **High degree of transaction independence**: Analysis of the same block sample revealed that approximately 60-80% of transactions within a block are fully independent from one another, meaning they access disjoint sets of storage slots. This high level of independence makes parallelization particularly effective, as most transactions can be processed concurrently.

### Block Size Considerations

Including access lists increases block size, potentially impacting network propagation times and blockchain liveness. Based on analysis of historical blocks:

- Average BAL size over 1,000 blocks was around 39 KiB (SSZ-encoded, snappy compressed)
- Worst-case BAL size for consuming the entire block gas limit (36m) with storage access operations would be approximately 0.93 MiB (this is smaller than worst-case calldata blocks and both are mutually exclusive)
- These sizes are manageable and less than the current worst-case block size achievable through calldata

### Asynchronous Validation

Block execution can proceed with parallel IO and parallel EVM operations, with verification of the access list occurring alongside execution, ensuring correctness without delaying block processing.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal requires changes to the block structure that are not backwards compatible and require a hard fork.

## Security Considerations

### Validation Overhead

Validating access lists and balance diffs adds validation overhead but is essential to prevent acceptance of invalid blocks.

### Block Size

Including comprehensive access lists increases block size, potentially impacting network propagation times. However, as noted in the rationale section, the overhead is reasonable given the performance benefits, with typical BALs averaging around 39 KiB in total.
