## Abstract

This proposal defines a general purpose framework for storing contract-triggered
requests. It extends the execution header with a single field to store the
request information. This inherently exposes the requests to the consensus
layer, which can then process each one.

## Motivation

The proliferation of smart contract controlled validators has caused there to be
a demand for additional EL triggered behaviors. By allowing these systems to
delegate administrative operations to their governing smart contracts, they can
avoid intermediaries needing to step in and ensure certain operations occur.
This creates a safer system for end users.

## Specification

### Execution Layer

#### Request

A `request` consists of a `request_type` prepended to an opaque byte array
`request_data`:

```
request = request_type ++ request_data
```

Let `requests` be the list of all `request` objects in the block in ascending
order by type. For example:

```
[0x00_request_0, 0x01_request_0, 0x01_request_1, 0x02_request_0, ...]
```

The ordering of requests within a type is to be defined by each request type.

#### Block Header

Extend the header with a new 32 byte value `requests_hash`:

```python
def compute_requests_hash(list):
    return keccak256(rlp.encode([rlp.encode(req) for req in list]))

block.header.requests_hash = compute_requests_hash(requests)
```

### Consensus Layer

Each proposal may choose how to extend the beacon chain types to include the new
EL request.

## Rationale

### Opaque byte array rather than an RLP array

By having the bytes of `request_data` array from second byte on be opaque bytes, rather
than an RLP (or other encoding) list, we can support different encoding formats for the
request payload in the future such as SSZ, LEB128, or a fixed width format.

### Request source and validity

This EIP makes no strict requirement where a request may come from nor when/how
a request must be validated. This is to provide future protocol designers
maximum flexibility.

The authors' recommendations on source and validity of requests are:

* The source of requests should be from the execution of transactions. More
  specifically, transactions which make calls to designated system contracts
  that store the request in account. The storage would later be retrieved by a
  post-block system call to the contract. Alternatively, if the system call does
  not need to be inherently concerned with rate limiting, it could rely simply
  on emitting an event which is later parsed post-block by the system and
  converted into a request.
* A request's validity can often not be fully verified at the execution layer.
  This is why they are referred to merely as "requests"; they do not carry the
  authority on their own to unilaterally catalyze an action. We expect the system
  contracts to perform whatever validation is possible by the EL and then pass
  it on to the CL for further validation.

### Ordering

The ordering across types is ascending by type. This is to simplify the process
of verifying that all requests which were committed to in `requests_hash` were
found in the block.

An alternative could be to order by when the request was generated within the
block. Since it's expected that many requests will be accumulated at the end of
the block via system calls, this would be difficult to enforce. Therefore,
ordering by type is the most straightforward ordering which ensures integrity.

#### Intra-type

Within the same type, order is not defined. This is because the data of the
request is opaque as far as this EIP is concerned. Therefore, it is to be
determined by each request type individually.
