## Abstract

Store last `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` historical block hashes in the storage of a system contract as part of the block processing logic.

This EIP has no impact on `BLOCKHASH` resolution mechanism (hence its range/costs etc).

## Motivation

EVM implicitly assumes the client has the recent block (hashes) at hand. This assumption is not future-proof given the prospect of stateless clients. Including the block hashes in the state will allow bundling these hashes in the witness provided to a stateless client. This is already possible in the MPT and will become more efficient post-Verkle.

Extending the range of blocks `BLOCKHASH` can serve is a semantics change. Using the contract storage would allow extending that range in a soft-transition. Rollups can benefit from the longer history window through directly querying this contract.

A side benefit of this approach could be that it allows building/validating proofs related to last `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` ancestors directly against the current state.

## Specification

| Parameter | Value |
| - | - |
| `FORK_TIMESTAMP` | TBD |
| `BLOCKHASH_SERVE_WINDOW` | `256` |
| `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` | `8192` |
| `SYSTEM_ADDRESS` | `0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe` |
| `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS` | `0x0aae40965e6800cd9b1f4b05ff21581047e3f91e`|

This EIP specifies for storing last `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` block hashes in a ring buffer storage of `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` length. Note that `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` > `BLOCKHASH_SERVE_WINDOW` (which remains unchanged).

At the start of processing any block where `block.timestamp >= FORK_TIMESTAMP` (ie. before processing any transactions), update the state directly in the following way:

```python
def process_block_hash_history(block: Block, state: State):
    if block.timestamp >= FORK_TIMESTAMP:
        state.insert_slot(HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS, (block.number-1) % HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW , block.parent.hash)
```

Alternatively clients can also choose to do a system update via a system call to the contract `set` mechanism defined in the following sections.

Note that, it will take `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` blocks after `FORK_TIMESTAMP` to completely fill up the ring buffer. The contract will only contain the parent hash of the fork block and no hashes prior to that.

As mentioned earlier the `BLOCKHASH` opcode semantics remains the same as before. However the clients which want to leverage the history from state may do so making sure the query is within `BLOCKHASH` range and is available in the contract.

### Contract Implementation

Exact evm assembly that can be used for the contract to resolve `BLOCKHASH`

```
// if system call then jump to the set operation
caller
push20 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe
eq
push1 0x57
jumpi

// check if input > 8 byte value and revert if this isn't the case
// the check is performed by comparing the biggest 8 byte number with
// the call data, which is a right-padded 32 byte number.
push8 0xffffffffffffffff
push0
calldataload
gt
push1 0x53
jumpi

// check if input > blocknumber-1 then return 0
push1 0x1
number
sub
push0
calldataload
gt
push1 0x4b
jumpi

// check if blocknumber > input + 8192 then return 0, no overflow expected for input of 8 bytes
push0
calldataload
push2 0x2000
add
number
gt
push1 0x4b
jumpi

// mod 8192 and sload
push2 0x1fff
push0
calldataload
and
sload

// load into mem and return 32 bytes
push0
mstore
push1 0x20
push0
return

// 0x4b: return 0
jumpdest
push0
push0
mstore
push1 0x20
push0
return

// 0x53: revert
jumpdest
push0
push0
revert

// 0x57: set op - sstore the input to number-1 mod 8192
jumpdest
push0
calldataload
push2 0x1fff
push1 0x1
number
sub
and
sstore

stop
```

#### Contract `get` and `set` mechanism

Similar to [EIP-4788](./eip-4788.md) above contract provides a `set` mechanism which clients can choose to update the block's parent hash in the ring buffer instead of direct state update. For this clients should call this contract with `SYSTEM_ADDRESS` as caller and provide `32` bytes parent block hash as input.

If caller is not `SYSTEM_ADDRESS` the contract treats it as `get` with contract reading `32` bytes input via `calldataload` as the `arg` to resolve the block hash for. Users and clients doing `get` EVM call should left pad the `arg` correctly.

#### Deployment

A special synthetic address is generated by working backwards from the desired deployment transaction:

```json
{
  "type": "0x0",
  "nonce": "0x0",
  "to": null,
  "gas": "0x3d090",
  "gasPrice": "0xe8d4a51000",
  "maxPriorityFeePerGas": null,
  "maxFeePerGas": null,
  "value": "0x0",
  "input": "0x60648060095f395ff33373fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe1460575767ffffffffffffffff5f3511605357600143035f3511604b575f35612000014311604b57611fff5f3516545f5260205ff35b5f5f5260205ff35b5f5ffd5b5f35611fff60014303165500",
  "v": "0x1b",
  "r": "0x539",
  "s": "0x1b9b6eb1f0",
  "hash": "0x3c769a03d6e2212f1d26ab59ba797dce0900df29ffd23c1dd391fd6b217973ad",
}
```

Note, the input in the transaction has a simple constructor prefixing the desired runtime code.

The sender of the transaction can be calculated as `0xe473f7e92ba2490e9fcbbe8bb9c3be3adbb74efc`. The address of the first contract deployed from the account is `rlp([sender, 0])` which equals `0x0aae40965e6800cd9b1f4b05ff21581047e3f91e`. This is how `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS` is determined. Although this style of contract creation is not tied to any specific initcode like create2 is, the synthetic address is cryptographically bound to the input data of the transaction (e.g. the initcode).


Some activation scenarios:

 * For the fork to be activated at genesis, no history is written to the genesis state, and at the start of block `1`, genesis hash will be written as a normal operation to slot `0`.
 * for activation at block `1`, only genesis hash will be written at slot `0`.
 * for activation at block `32`, block `31`'s hash will be written to slot `31`. Every other slot will be `0`.

### [EIP-158](./eip-158.md) handling

The bytecode above will be deployed à la [EIP-4788](./eip-4788.md). As such the account at `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS` will have code and a nonce of 1, and will be exempt from EIP-158 cleanup.

### Gas costs

The system update at the beginning of the block, i.e. `process_block_hash_history` (or via system call to the contract with `SYSTEM_ADDRESS` caller), will not warm the `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS` account or its storage slots as per [EIP-2929](./eip-2929.md) rules. As such the first call to the contract will pay for warming up the account and storage slots it accesses.To clarify further any contract call to the `HISTORY_STORAGE_ADDRESS` will follow normal EVM execution semantics.

Since `BLOCKHASH` semantics doesn't change, this EIP has no impact on `BLOCKHASH` mechanism and costs.

## Rationale

Very similar ideas were proposed before in [EIP-210](./eip-210.md) et al. This EIP is a simplification, removing two sources of needless complexity:

1. Having a tree-like structure with multiple layers as opposed to a single list
2. Writing the EIP in EVM code
3. Serial unbounded storage of hashes for a deep access to the history

However after weighing pros and cons, we decided to go with just a limited ring buffer to only serve the requisite `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` as [EIP-4788](./eip-4788.md) and beacon state accumulators allow (albeit a bit more complex) proof against any ancestor since merge.

Second concern was how to best transition the BLOCKHASH resolution logic post fork by:

1. Either waiting for  `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` blocks for the entire relevant history to persist
2. Storing of all last `HISTORY_SERVE_WINDOW` block hashes on the fork block.

We choose to go with the former. It simplifies the logic greatly. It will take roughly a day to bootstrap the contract. Given that this is a new way of accessing history and no contract depends on it, it is deemed a favorable tradeoff.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP introduces backwards incompatible changes to the block validation rule set. But neither of these changes break anything related to current user activity and experience.

## Test Cases

TBD

## Security Considerations

Having contracts (system or otherwise) with hot update paths (branches) poses a risk of "branch" poisioning attacks where attacker could sprinkle trivial amounts of eth around these hot paths (branches). But it has been deemed that cost of attack would escalate significantly to cause any meaningful slow down of state root updates.
