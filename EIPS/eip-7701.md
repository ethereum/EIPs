## Abstract

We propose splitting the Ethereum transaction scope into multiple steps: validations, execution, and post-operation logic. Transaction validity is determined by the result of the validation steps of a transaction.

We further separate transaction validation for the purposes of authorization and the gas fee payment, allowing one contract to pay gas for a transaction that will be executed from another contract.

## Motivation

Native Account Abstraction allows custom validation logic of a transaction and custom gas payment logic, opening new use-cases and features for wallets and dApps.

### New Transaction Type

A new [EIP-2718](./eip-2718) transaction with type `AA_TX_TYPE` is introduced.
Transactions of this type are referred to as "AA transactions".

Their payload should be interpreted as:

```

AA_TX_TYPE || rlp([
  chain_id,
  nonce,
  sender, sender_validation_data,
  deployer, deployer_data,
  paymaster, paymaster_data,
  sender_execution_data,
  valid_after, valid_until,
  max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas,
  sender_validation_gas_limit, paymaster_validation_gas_limit,
  sender_execution_gas_limit, paymaster_post_op_gas_limit,
  access_list,
  authorization_list
])

```

### Definitions

* **Smart Contract Account**: an Ethereum smart contract that serves as the user's account and on-chain identity.
  It is responsible for holding user's assets, verifying user requests, and executing actions on the user's behalf.
* **Sender**: the Smart Contract Account sending the current AA transaction.
* **Paymaster**: a smart contract that is requested to pay gas fees for the current AA transaction on behalf of the
  `Sender` contract.
* **Factory**: a smart contract that performs a deployment for a new `Sender` contract if necessary in the context of
  the current AA transaction.
* **Entity**: a common term for any of the smart contracts mentioned above in the context of an EIP-7701 Transaction.
* **Transaction Validity**:
  A property of an Ethereum transaction that describes whether this transaction can be included in a block without a
  violation of the ethereum execution and consensus rules.
  This property depends on both the inputs of the transaction and the current state of the Ethereum blockchain and can
  change over time.
* **EIP-7701 Transaction**: the entire transaction initiated by the `Sender` Smart Contract Account and represented with
  an [EIP-2718](./eip-2718) compatible Transaction Envelope object.
* **Call Frame**: The context and state for a specific function call during contract execution, including input
  parameters, local variables, and the execution environment.
* **Top-Level Call Frame**: The initial execution context of a transaction accessing the contract, the "entry point" to
  the EVM code.
* **EIP-7701 Call Frame**:
  A single atomic element of EVM code execution,
  represented by a single top-level call to a specific address with a given data.
  An EIP-7701 call frame may contain inner call frames as well, but they are not referred to as "EIP-7701 call frames".
  An EIP-7701 call frame may either succeed or revert.
* **Frame's Role**:
  An identifier of an action that the invoked contract is asked to make during the current call frame.
  An Entity may have one or more roles as part of the EIP-7701 Transaction flow. 
* **EIP-7701 Transaction Phase**:
  A set of EIP-7701 Call Frames that form a single step in an EIP-7701 Transaction flow.
  There are two phases in an EIP-7701 Transaction: *validation* and *execution*
* **Validation phase**:
  A set of EIP-7701 Call Frames that define the current EIP-7701 Transaction's **Validity** by executing the
  **validation** EVM code.
* **Execution phase**:
  A set of EIP-7701 Call Frames that perform the actions according to the `Sender` and the `Paymaster` contracts'
  interpretation of the user input.
  These frames do not define the **Validity** of the transaction.

The base gas cost of this transaction is set to `AA_BASE_GAS_COST` instead of 21000 to reflect the lack of "intrinsic"
ECDSA signature verification.

### Validation and PostOp call frame roles

We define the following values as valid ones for the `current_frame_role` variable:

```python
role_sender_deployment = 0xA0
role_sender_validation = 0xA1
role_paymaster_validation = 0xA2
role_sender_execution = 0xA3
role_paymaster_post_op = 0xA4
```

### New `ACCEPTROLE` opcode

This opcode allows the invoked contract to explicitly accept executing a certain role as an entity in the EIP-7701 transaction.
This opcode is treated same as the `INVALID (0xFE)` opcode if executed in a transaction of a different type.

It takes `3` stack argument:

   * `role`: the exact role this entity agrees to perform.
   * `offset`: byte offset in the memory in bytes, to copy what will be the return data of this context.
   * `size`: byte size of the return data to copy.

A valid call to the `ACCEPTROLE` opcode is an equivalent of the `RETURN (0xF3)` opcode and exits the current context successfully.

### Global `current_frame_role` variable

During the execution of the `Sender`, `Paymaster` or a `Deployer` code as defined by the `AA_TX_TYPE` transaction,
the global `current_frame_role` variable is set to the corresponding role.
The `current_frame_role` remains set through an uninterrupted chain of `DELEGATECALL` calls.

By default, the value for `current_frame_role` is not set. Call frames initiated with any opcodes other than
`DELEGATECALL` run without a role.

If by the end of the execution of the `Sender`, `Paymaster` or a `Deployer` code
`current_frame_role` is not explicitly accepted by using the `ACCEPTROLE` opcode,
the EIP-7701 Call Frame reverts.

An EIP-7701 transaction is valid if and only if the following conditions are met for each of
`role_sender_deployment`, `role_sender_validation`, `role_paymaster_validation`:

* The top-level call frame did not revert.
* `ACCEPTROLE` was called exactly once and with the correct role input parameter equal to `current_frame_role`,
either in the top level call frame, or in an uninterrupted chain of `DELEGATECALL` calls.

The `role_sender_execution` and `role_paymaster_post_op` EIP-7701 Call Frame is reverted if
a corresponding `ACCEPTROLE` opcode was not executed, executed for a wrong role, or executed more than once.

### New `TXPARAMLOAD`, `TXPARAMSIZE`, and `TXPARAMCOPY` opcodes

Accessing transaction details within call frames is performed using the new `TXPARAM*` opcode family.
The instructions accept the parameter identifier value that we call `txparam_id`.

The `TXPARAMDLOAD`, `TXPARAMSIZE`, `TXPARAMCOPY` follow the pattern of `CALLDATA*` / `RETURNDATA*` opcode
families.

1. `TXPARAMSIZE` opcode puts the byte size of the transaction parameter value defined by the input `txparam_id`.
   It takes `1` stack argument:
   * `txparam_id`: identifier of the queried transaction parameter.
2. `TXPARAMLOAD` opcode takes the byte offset in the specified transaction parameter from stack and puts the
   32-byte value starting from the given offset of the specified transaction parameter to stack.\
   It takes `2` stack argument:
   * `txparam_id`: identifier of the queried transaction parameter.
   * `offset`: byte offset in the transaction parameter to copy.
3. `TXPARAMCOPY` opcode copies data from the appropriate dynamically sized transaction parameter to memory.\
   It takes `4` stack arguments:
   * `txparam_id`: identifier of the queried transaction parameter.
   * `dest_offset`: byte offset in the memory where the result will be copied.
   * `offset`: byte offset in the transaction parameter to copy.
   * `size`: byte size to copy.

The valid values for `txparam_id` are described in the table below.
Note that some parameters are "optional" for AA transactions, and these parameters have default values as stated below.

| `txparam_id` | Return value                     | Data size | Default      | Comment                                   |

### Limitations on `TXPARAM*` opcodes

The `TXPARAM*` opcodes are only enabled in frames with a correct `current_frame_role`.
Calling these opcodes in another context, or with invalid `txparam_id`, returns zero values and zero lengths.

| `current_frame_role`                                                            | allowed `txparam_id`                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 (none)                                                                        | None, `TXPARAM*` opcodes always return zero value and zero length                                          |
| `role_sender_deployment`, `role_sender_validation`, `role_paymaster_validation` | All tx parameters, `current_frame_role`, `tx_hash_for_signature`                                           |
| `role_paymaster_post_op`                                                        | All tx parameters, `current_frame_role`, `tx_hash_for_signature`, `execution_status`, `execution_gas_cost` |
| `role_sender_execution`                                                         | Only `current_frame_role`                                                                                  |


Contact should first call `TXPARAMLOAD 0xF0` (`current_frame_role`) to determine the current frame role.

In case `current_frame_role` is not set for the current frame it has a default value of `0`.

### `TXPARAM*` opcodes gas prices

The new opcodes have gas prices equivalent to corresponding `CALLDATA*` opcodes:

1. `TXPARAMLOAD` - static value of `3` gas
2. `TXPARAMSIZE`- static value of `2` gas
3. `TXPARAMCOPY` - dynamic formula

    ```
    minimum_word_size = (size + 31) / 32
    static_gas = 3
    dynamic_gas = 3 * minimum_word_size + memory_expansion_cost
    ```

#### Time range validity (optional)

If the `valid_until` field is non-zero, the transaction is only valid for inclusion in a block with a timestamp at most `valid_until` value.
Similarly, the transaction is only valid for inclusion in blocks with a timestamp at most the `valid_after` value.

#### Sender Deployment (optional)

Inputs to the `deployer` contract are not defined by the protocol and are controlled by the `deployer_data` parameter.

The sender deployment frame MUST result in the `sender` address becoming initialized with contract code.

This step is performed with the `role_sender_deployment` role.

#### Sender Validation

This step is performed with the `role_sender_validation` role.

In order for the transaction to be considered valid, the
sender validation frame MUST return without reverting.

#### Paymaster Validation (optional)

This step is performed with the `role_paymaster_validation` role.

In order for the transaction to be considered valid, the paymaster validation frame MUST return without reverting.
If it does, the `Paymaster` contract is charged for the transaction gas costs instead of the `Sender`.

#### Sender Execution

This step is performed with the `role_sender_execution` role.

Inputs to the `Sender` contract are not defined by the protocol and are controlled by the `sender_execution_data` parameter.

#### Paymaster post-operation frame (optional)

This step is performed with the `role_paymaster_post_op` role.

It is intended to provide the Paymaster contract with an opportunity to finalize any calculations after the
results of the Sender Execution are known.

The `execution_status` and `execution_gas_cost` values are accessible via the `TXPARAMLOAD` opcode.

The post-operation frame is considered an integral part of the transaction execution phase.
It means that if the post-operation frame reverts its execution, the Sender Execution state changes are also reverted.

### Transaction Execution Flow

All legacy transaction types only have an implicit validation phase where balance, nonce, and signature are checked,
and an implicit execution phase with a single top-level execution frame.

For all legacy transaction types, during the single top-level execution frame,
the `ORIGIN` (`0x32`, `tx.origin`) and `CALLER` (`0x33`, `msg.sender`)
are both equal to the address that is determined by the transaction's ECDSA signature (`yParity`, `r`, `s`).

When processing an EIP-7701 transaction, however, multiple execution frames will be created.
The full list of possible frames and their corresponding role definitions is as follows:

1. **Validation Phase**
    * `sender` deployment frame (once per account) - `role_sender_deployment`
    * `sender` validation frame (required) - `role_sender_validation`
    * `paymaster` validation frame (optional) - `role_paymaster_validation`
2. **Execution Phase**
    * `sender` execution frame (required) - `role_sender_execution`
    * `paymaster` post-operation frame (optional) - `role_paymaster_post_op`

All execution frames in the **Validation Phase** must be completed successfully without reverting
in order for the transaction to be considered valid for a given position in a block.

In all top-level frames, the global variables have the following meaning:

| Opcode Name | Solidity Equivalent | Value                                                                                                           |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CALLER`    | `msg.sender`        | The `AA_ENTRY_POINT` address                                                                                    |
| `ORIGIN`    | `tx.origin`         | The transaction `sender` address                                                                                |
| `CALLDATA*` | `msg.data`          | Empty for all call frames except for the sender execution frame, for which it is set to `sender_execution_data` |

### Transaction execution context

Note that some behaviours in the EVM depend on the transaction context. These behaviours include:

1. Costs of the `SSTORE (0x55)` opcode per [EIP-2200](./eip-2200)
2. Costs of accessing cold addresses and slots per [EIP-2929](./eip-2929)
3. Values available within the transient storage per [EIP-1153](./eip-1153)
4. Maximum amount of gas refund assigned after the execution per [EIP-3529](./eip-3529)

These features are not affected by the separation of the transaction into multiple frames.
Meaning, for example, that a value set with `TSTORE (0x5D)` in one frame will remain available in the next one.

### Costs of accessing cold addresses for Sender, Paymaster, and Deployer

The Sender address is pre-warmed as part of the `AA_BASE_GAS_COST`.

When non-zero address, that is not equal to the Sender address, is provided for a Paymaster or a Deployer contract,
an additional EIP-2929 `COLD_ACCOUNT_READ_COST` cost of 2600 gas is charged and the address is added to `accessed_addresses`.

### Pseudocode

#### AA transaction state transition function

```python

def state_transition_function(tx, block, state):
    max_gas = sum(tx.params[role].gas_limit for role in ROLES)
    gas_price = min(tx.max_fee_per_gas, block.base_fee_per_gas + tx.max_priority_fee_per_gas)
    total_max_cost = max_gas * gas_price
    if tx.paymaster is None:
        balances[tx.sender] -= total_max_cost
    else:
        balances[tx.paymaster] -= total_max_cost

    if get_code(tx.sender) is None:
        deployer_result = call_with_params(tx, role_sender_deployment)
        assert deployer_result.success

    sender_result = call_with_params(tx, role_sender_validation)
    assert sender_result.success

    if tx.paymaster:
        paymaster_result = call_with_params(tx, role_paymaster_validation)
        assert paymaster_result.success

    checkpoint = state.take_snapshot()
    call_with_params(tx, role_sender_execution)
    if tx.paymaster:
        postop_result = call_with_params(tx, role_paymaster_post_op)
        if postop_result.success is not True:
            state.revert_snapshot(checkpoint)
        balances[tx.paymaster] += gas_refund
    else:
        balances[tx.sender] += gas_refund


def call_with_params(tx, role):
    return call(

        tx.params[role].data, tx.params[role].gaslimit
    )


def call(from_address, target_role, target_address, call_data, gas_limit):
    result = execute_code_with_role(from_address, target_role, target_address, call_data, gas_limit)
    success = result.success and result.role_performed is True
    return {"success": success}


# This function is almost identical to the original EVM call frame transition function.
# In addition, it returns 'role_performed' value:
# True if the 'target_role' was accepted using the `ACCEPTROLE` opcode executed either in the top-level call,
# or for an inner call made with an uninterrupted 'DELEGATECALL' opcodes chain

#### Block transition function

```python
def block_transition_function(block):
    for index, tx in enumerate(block.txs):
        if is_type_aa(tx):
            try:
                if (tx.valid_until != 0 and tx.valid_until <= block.timestamp) or tx.valid_after >= block.timestamp:
                    raise Exception("time range violation")
                state_transition_function(tx, block)
            except Exception:
                # validation failed and this transaction could not have been included in the current block
                raise Exception("invalid AA Transaction in block")
        else:
            legacy_state_transition_function(tx)
```

## Rationale

### Introduction of the `TXPARAM*` opcode family

The validation calls of a Smart Contract Account code need to have full access to the majority of transaction
details in order to be able to make an informed decision about either accepting or rejecting the transaction.

A small subset of this data is available with the existing opcodes, like `CALLER (0x33)` or `GASPRICE  (0x3A)`.
However, creating an opcode for every transaction parameter is not feasible or desirable.

The `TXPARAM*` opcode family provides the Account Abstraction contracts with access to this data.

These values are not made accessible to the transactions' execution or to legacy transaction types.
This limitation prevents the `TXPARAM*` opcode family from becoming a new source of a globally observable state,
which could create backwards compatibility issues in the future.

## Backwards Compatibility

## Security Considerations

As the `ACCEPTROLE` opcode represent a generic way to authorize any action on behalf of the contract,
correct and secure implementation of this code is critical.
We expect that compilers targeting EVM will play a major role in enabling and ensuring Smart Contract Accounts' security.

For smart contract security auditors and security-oriented developer tools it is crucial to ensure that contracts not
meant to have roles in AA transactions do not have unexpected `ACCEPTROLE` opcode.
Otherwise, these contracts may present an immediate security threat.

As an example, block explorers should tag contracts as "user accounts" or "paymasters" if they have the `ACCEPTROLE` opcode used in their source code.
