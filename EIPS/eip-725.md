## Simple Summary
A standard interface for a smart contract based account with attachable key value store.

## Abstract

The following describes standard functions for a unique smart contract based account that can be used by humans,
groups, organisations, objects and machines.

The standard is divided into two sub standards:

`ERC725X`:
Can execute arbitrary smart contracts and deploy other smart contracts.

`ERC725Y`:
Can hold arbitrary data through a generic key/value store.

## Motivation

Standardizing a minimal interface for a smart contract based account allows any interface to operate through these account types.
Smart contact based accounts following this standard have the following advantages:

- can hold any asset (native token, e.g. ERC20 like tokens)
- can execute any smart contract and deploy smart contracts
- have upgradeable security (through owner change, e.g. to a gnosis safe)
- are basic enough to work for for a long time
- are extensible though additional standardisation of the key/value data.
- can function as an owner/controller or proxy of other smart contracts


## Specification

### ERC725X 

ERC165 identifier: `0x44c028fe`

#### execute

```solidity
function execute(uint256 operationType, address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) public payable returns(bytes memory)
```

Executes a call on any other smart contracts, transfers the blockchains native token, or deploys a new smart contract.
MUST only be called by the current owner of the contract.

_Parameters:_
- `operationType`: the operation to execute.
- `to`: the smart contract or address to interact with. `to` will be unused if a contract is created (operation 1 and 2).
- `value`: the value of ETH to transfer.
- `data`: the call data, or the contract data to deploy.

_Returns:_ `bytes` , the returned data of the called function, or the address of the contract created (operation 1 and 2).

The `operationType` can execute the following operations:
- `0` for `call`
- `1` for `create`
- `2` for `create2`
- `3` for `staticcall`
- `4` for `delegatecall`

Others may be added in the future.

**Triggers Event:**  [ContractCreated](#contractcreated), [Executed](#executed) 

### Events

#### Executed

```solidity
event Executed(uint256 indexed _operation, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _value, bytes _data);
``` 
MUST be triggered when `execute` creates a new call using the `operationType` `0`, `3`, `4`.


#### ContractCreated

```solidity
event ContractCreated(address indexed contractAddress)
```
MUST be triggered when `execute` creates a new contract using the `operationType` `1`, `2`.

### ERC725Y

ERC165 identifier: `0x5a988c0f`

#### getData

```solidity
function getData(bytes32[] memory _keys) public view returns(bytes[] memory)
```
Gets array of data at multiple given key.

_Parameters:_
- `_keys`: the keys which values to retrieve.

_Returns:_ `bytes[]` , array of the values for the requested keys.
#### setData

```solidity
function setData(bytes32[] memory _keys, bytes[] memory _values) public 
```
Sets array of data at multiple keys. MUST only be called by the current owner of the contract.

_Parameters:_
- `_keys`: the keys which values to retrieve.
- `_values`: the array of bytes to set.

**Triggers Event:** [DataChanged](#datachanged)

### Events

#### DataChanged

```solidity
event DataChanged(bytes32 indexed key, bytes value)
```
MUST be triggered when `setData` was successfully called.

### Ownership

This contract is controlled by an owner. The owner can be a smart contract or an external account.
This standard requires [ERC173](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-173.md) and should implement the functions:

- `owner() view`
- `transferOwnership(address newOwner)` <br>

The event:
- `OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner)`

### Data keys

Data keys, should be the keccak256 hash of a type name.
e.g. `keccak256('ERCXXXMyNewKeyType')` is `0x6935a24ea384927f250ee0b954ed498cd9203fc5d2bf95c735e52e6ca675e047`

The [ERC725JSONSchema standard](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/master/LSPs/LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema.md) defines how keys should be named and generated.
This JSON schema can be used to auto decode ERC725Y values from smart contracts for application and smart contract interactions. 

#### Default key values

ERC725 key standards need to be defined within new standards, we suggest the following defaults:

| Name | Description | Key | value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SupportedStandards:XYZ | Allows to determine standards supported by this contract | `0xeafec4d89fa9619884b6b89135626455000000000000000000000000xxxxxxxx`, where `xxxxxxxx` is the 4 bytes identifier of the standard supported | Value can be defined by the standard, by default it should be the 4 bytes identifier  e.g. `0x7a30e6fc` |
| SupportedStandards:ERC725Account | Allows to determine standards supported by this contract | `0xeafec4d89fa9619884b6b89135626455000000000000000000000000afdeb5d6`, where `afdeb5d6` is the 4 bytes part of the hash of `keccak256('ERC725Account')` | Value is the 4 bytes identifier `0xafdeb5d6` |

#### ERC725Account

The specification of an ERC725Account can be found in [LSP0-ERC725Account](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/master/LSPs/LSP-0-ERC725Account.md).
## Rationale

The purpose of an smart contract account is to allow an entity to exist as a first-class citizen with the ability to execute arbitrary contract calls.
