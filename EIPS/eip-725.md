## Simple Summary
A standard interface for a smart contract based account with attachable key value store.

## Abstract

The following describes standard functions for a unique smart contract based account that can be used by humans,
groups, organisations, objects and machines.

The standard is divided into two sub standards:

`ERC725X`:
Can execute arbitrary smart contracts using and deploy other smart contracts.

`ERC725Y`:
Can hold arbitrary data through a generic key/value store.

## Motivation

Standardizing a minimal interface for a smart contract based account allows any interface to operate through these account types.
Smart contact based accounts following this standard have the following advantages:

- can hold any asset (native token, e.g. ERC20 like tokens)
- can execute any smart contract and deploy smart contracts
- have upgradeable security (through owner change, e.g. to a gnosis safe)
- are basic enough to work for for a long time
- are extensible though additional standardisation of the key/value data.
- can function as an owner/controller or proxy of other smart contracts


## Specification

### ERC725X 

ERC165 identifier: `0x44c028fe`

#### execute

Executes a call on any other smart contracts, transfers the blockchains native token, or deploys a new smart contract.
MUST only be called by the current owner of the contract.

```js
function execute(uint256 operationType, address to, uint256 value, bytes data)
```

The `operationType` can execute the following operations:
- `0` for `call`
- `1` for `delegatecall`
- `2` for `create2`
- `3` for `create`

Others may be added in the future.

**Triggers Event:** [ContractCreated](#contractcreated) if a contract was created

### Events

#### ContractCreated

MUST be triggered when `execute` creates a new contract using the `_operationType` `1`.

```js
event ContractCreated(address indexed contractAddress)
```

### ERC725Y

ERC165 identifier: `0x2bd57b73`

#### getData

Returns the data at the specified key.

```js
function getData(bytes32 key) external view returns(bytes value)
```

#### setData

Sets the data at a specific key. MUST only be called by the current owner of the contract.

**Triggers Event:** [DataChanged](#datachanged)

```js
function setData(bytes32 _key, bytes memory _value) external
```

### Events

#### DataChanged

MUST be triggered when `setData` was successfully called.

```js
event DataChanged(bytes32 indexed key, bytes value)
```


### Ownership

This contract is controlled by an owner. The owner can be a smart contract or an external account.
This standard requires [ERC173](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-173.md) and should implement the functions:

- `owner() view`
- `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`
- and the Event `event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner)`

### Data keys

Data keys, should be the keccak256 hash of a type name.
e.g. `keccak256('ERCXXXMyNewKeyType')` is `0x6935a24ea384927f250ee0b954ed498cd9203fc5d2bf95c735e52e6ca675e047`

The [ERC725JSONSchema standard](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/master/LSPs/LSP-2-ERC725YJSONSchema.md) defines how keys should be named and generated.
This JSON schema can be used to auto decode ERC725Y values from smart contracts for application and smart contract interactions. 

#### Default key values

ERC725 key standards need to be defined within new standards, we suggest the following defaults:

| Name | Description | Key | value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SupportedStandards:XYZ | Allows to determine standards supported by this contract | `0xeafec4d89fa9619884b6b89135626455000000000000000000000000xxxxxxxx`, where `xxxxxxxx` is the 4 bytes identifier of the standard supported | Value can be defined by the standard, by default it should be the 4 bytes identifier  e.g. `0x7a30e6fc` |
| SupportedStandards:ERC725Account | Allows to determine standards supported by this contract | `0xeafec4d89fa9619884b6b89135626455000000000000000000000000afdeb5d6`, where `afdeb5d6` is the 4 bytes part of the hash of `keccak256('ERC725Account')` | Value is the 4 bytes identifier `0xafdeb5d6` |


Other key examples COULD be:

| Name | Description | Key | value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ERC735 | A personal claim holder contract (per [ERC735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735)) | `0x33f5765e0b3f726091f5ab06cd801c2bcd9bf89228534161c70fd7e257b8bfa3` | 20 bytes value `0xcafecafe69a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb69cafe` |
| ERC780 | A registry claim holder contract (per [ERC780](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780)) | `0x62db7b9279d03518c54464b4946aade7cafabff066a90c55b054d5c5ee04c371` | 20 bytes value `0xcafecafe69a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb69cafe` |

##### ERC725Account

An `SupportedStandards` > `ERC725Account` (See key > value above) is an ERC725 smart contract based account/profile for storing of assets and execution of other smart contracts.

- `ERC173` to be controllable by an owner, that could be am external account, or smart contract
- `ERC725X` to interact with other smart contracts
- `ERC725Y` to attach data to the account for future extensibility
- COULD have [ERC1271](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1271.md) to be able to verify signatures by the owner (or owner contracts keys).
- Should fire the `event ValueReceived(address indexed sender, uint256 indexed value)` if ETH is received.

A full implementation of an `ERC725Account` can be found [found here](https://github.com/ERC725Alliance/ERC725/tree/master/implementations/contracts).

## Rationale

The purpose of an smart contract account is to allow an entity to exist as a first-class citizen with the ability to execute arbitrary contract calls.
