## Abstract

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
This standard is an extension of [EIP-20](./eip-20.md). This specification provides a type of escrow service in the blockchain ecosystem, which includes the following capabilities.
- The issuer issues tokens.
- The issuer creates an escrow smart contract with detailed escrow information. The information could include issuer token contract address, buyer token contract address,  lock period, exchange rate, the maximum number of buyers, minimum balance of buyers and, etc.
- The issuer funds issuer tokens to the escrow contract.
- Buyers fund buyer tokens which are pre-defined in the escrow contract.
- When the escrow status meets success, the seller can withdraw buyer tokens and buyers can withdraw seller tokens based on exchange rates.
- Buyers can withdraw(or refund) their funded token if the escrow process is failed or is in the middle of the escrow process.

We have suggested this process be possible in an on-chain network with a payable currency-like token(ex: USDT).

## Motivation

Escrow service holds the money until a particular condition has been met for the seller and buyer.  By `ERC5503` standard, smart contract developers can define a wide range of rules to make the deals more successful.

## Specification

There are 3 contracts for the escrow process: `Buyer Contract`, `Seller Contract`, and `Escrow Contract`.
 - Buyer Contract: Buyers will pay to an escrow account to exchange with `Seller Token`.
 - Seller Contract: The seller will pay to the escrow account to exchange with `Buyer Token`.
 - Escrow Contract: Will be created by the seller. The contract source code allows users(seller and buyers) based on constraint rules. Instead of a simple address mapped balance variable in ERC20 tokens, the user’s balance should be [Seller Token, Buyer Token].

**Every ERC-5503 compliant contract must implement the `ERC5503` interfaces**
```solidity

## Rationale

This standard proposes interfaces on top of the ERC-20 standard.
Each function should include constraint check logic.
The escrow-contract should implement internal constraint logic such as
 - Lock period
 - Maximum(or minimum) number of investors
 - Maximum(or minimum) number of tokens to fund
 - Exchange rates of seller/buyer token
 - KYC verification of users(It might require additional interface)
 - etc

The buyer-contract and seller-contract should not have constraint rules.

Let's discuss the following functions.

1. **constructor**

An escrow contract will define success/failure conditions. It means constraint rules might not be changed forever (might be changed after being created for the market exchange rate.), so it guarantees escrow policy.

2. **escrowFund**

This function should run differently for buyers and sellers.

2.1 [Seller]
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
- The seller calls this function to be escrow-ready. The seller's token ownership(balance) will be transferred to the escrow contract and the escrow balance should be `(Seller: amount, Buyer: 0)`.
=======
- The seller calls this function to be escrow-ready. Seller's token ownership(balance) will be transferred to escrow-contract and the escrow balance should be `(Seller: amount, Buyer: 0)`.
>>>>>>> 8076a954 (document update for typo and un-clear issue)
=======
- The seller calls this function to be escrow-ready. The seller's token ownership(balance) will be transferred to the escrow contract and the escrow balance should be `(Seller: amount, Buyer: 0)`.
>>>>>>> a78dc44e (Update eip-5503.md)
- The seller can call this function multiple times depending on implementation, but preferred just one time.

2.2 [Buyer]
- During the escrow process, the buyer should be able to call this function to deposit funds into the escrow account.
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
- The escrow balance should be  `(Seller: amount X exchange rate, Buyer: amount)`. The Buyer: the amount will be used for the refund process.
- In a successful scenario, the seller's escrow balance should be `(Seller: -= amount X exchange rate, Buyer: += amount)`.
=======
- The escrow balance should be  `(Seller: amount X exchange-rate, Buyer: amount)`. The Buyer: the amount will be used for the refund process.
- In a successful scenario, the seller's escrow balance should be `(Seller: -= amount X exchange-rate, Buyer: += amount)`.
>>>>>>> 8076a954 (document update for typo and un-clear issue)
=======
- The escrow balance should be  `(Seller: amount X exchange rate, Buyer: amount)`. The Buyer: the amount will be used for the refund process.
- In a successful scenario, the seller's escrow balance should be `(Seller: -= amount X exchange rate, Buyer: += amount)`.
>>>>>>> a78dc44e (Update eip-5503.md)

3. **escrowRefund**

This function should be invoked by buyers only.
The buyer can call this function in the running state only. In the state of failure or success, could not be a success.
The escrow balances of seller and buyer will be updated reverse way of `escrowFund`


4. **escrowWithdraw**

Buyers and sellers can withdraw tokens from the escrow account to their account.
The following processes are recommended.
- Buyer can withdraw in escrow-success state only. Ownership of seller tokens can be transferred to the buyer from escrow-contract. In an escrow-failed state, the buyer should call the `escrowRefund` function.
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
- When the seller calls this function in the escrow-success state, the remaining seller token will be transferred to the seller, and the earned buyer's token will be also transferred from the escrow-account.
=======
- When the seller calls this function in the escrow-success state, the remaining seller token will be transferred to the seller, and the earned buyer's token will be also transferred from escrow-account.
>>>>>>> 8076a954 (document update for typo and un-clear issue)
=======
- When the seller calls this function in the escrow-success state, the remaining seller token will be transferred to the seller, and the earned buyer's token will be also transferred from the escrow-account.
>>>>>>> a78dc44e (Update eip-5503.md)
- In the case of escrow-failed, the seller only gets a refund seller token.

## Backward Compatibility
By design, ERC-5503 is fully backward compatible with ERC-20.

## Test Cases
1. [Seller/Buyer Token example](../assets/eip-5503/ERC20Mockup.sol).
2. [Escrow contract example](../assets/eip-5503/EscrowContractAccount.sol).
3. [Unit test example with truffle](../assets/eip-5503/truffule-test.js).

The above 3 files demonstrate the following conditions for exchanging seller/buyer tokens.

The above 3 files demonstrate the following conditions to exchange seller / buyer tokens.

>>>>>>> 8076a954 (document update for typo and un-clear issue)
=======
The above 3 files demonstrate the following conditions for exchanging seller/buyer tokens.
- The exchange rate is one to one.
>>>>>>> a78dc44e (Update eip-5503.md)
- If the number of buyers reaches 2, the escrow process will be terminated(success).
- Otherwise(not meet success condition yet), buyers can refund(or withdraw) their funded tokens.

## Security Considerations
Since the external contract(Escrow Contract) will control seller or buyer rights, flaws within the escrow contract directly lead to the standard’s unexpected behavior.
