## Abstract

This EIP introduces **ZW-Token**, a fungible token standard with **strictly irreversible supply**, **no re-minting path**, a **single canonical state**, no synthetic mirrors, and no alternate supply layers.

The standard enforces a **single canonical supply state**. Optional privacy layers may be added via obfuscation, **not** by creating parallel supply representations.

## Motivation

Most fungible ERC-20 tokens today allow:

- reclaimable burns,
- synthetic supply mirrors,
- wrapped abstractions introducing alternate supply states,
- and reversible minting mechanics.

These create fragmentation, mirrored supplies, and inconsistencies across layers.

**ZW-Token** solves this by defining:

1. **Immutable Total Supply Constraint**  
   Burned units are permanently removed.

2. **Single-State Supply Representation**  
   No minting paths after burn events and no synthetic replicas.

3. **No Alternate Mirrors nor Wrapped Layers**  
   Only one canonical supply state can exist on-chain.

4. **Optional Privacy Without Supply Duplication**  
   Privacy is achieved only by obfuscation—not by creating hidden or mirrored balances.

## Specification

### 1. Irreversible Burn

Calling `burn(address from, uint256 amount)` must:

- reduce total supply permanently,  
- emit a `Transfer(from, address(0), amount)` event,  
- forbid any future mint restoring burned supply.

### 2. No Re-Mint Path

Implementations **must not** provide any function capable of:

- increasing total supply after deployment,
- restoring burned units,
- or minting synthetic equivalents.

### 3. Single-State Value Representation

All balances MUST reference a single canonical ERC-20 state.  
The token MUST NOT be wrapped or mirrored into any alternate ERC-20 representation that affects supply semantics.

### 4. Optional Privacy Layer

Privacy extensions may be included **only** if they:

- do not alter total supply,  
- do not create alternate supply trees,  
- and do not maintain synthetic or private mirrors.

## Rationale

Fragmented supply representations introduce discrepancies and auditing failures.  
A strictly irreversible supply eliminates:

- double representation of burned amounts,  
- inconsistencies across wrapped layers,  
- and synthetic minting vulnerabilities.

This design is based on the live on-chain experiment **TEN.IO — Fragment 0 ("El Umbral")**, which demonstrates the feasibility of irreversible supply and unfragmented value representation.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is fully backward compatible with ERC-20.  
Clients may treat ZW-Token as a standard ERC-20 with additional invariants.

## Security Considerations

Irreversible supply requires careful handling of:

- burn logic,  
- prevention of hidden mint paths,  
- preventing synthetic re-issuance via wrappers or mirrors.

Implementers must guarantee that **no upgrade path** or proxy mechanism can introduce new minting functionality.
