## Abstract

This EIP introduces **ZW-Token**, a fungible token standard in which the **total supply is strictly irreversible**. Units destroyed via `burn` are permanently removed, with **no re-minting path, no reversible destroy mechanics, and no synthetic or mirrored representations**.

The standard enforces a **single canonical supply state**, ensuring that no wrapped layers, derivative assets, or privacy layers introduce alternate supply trees. Optional privacy is achieved exclusively through obfuscation, not by creating new value representations.

## Motivation

Most fungible ERC-20 tokens allow:

- reclaimable burns,
- synthetic supply mirrors,
- wrapped or bridged representations,
- L2 shadow supply,
- and upgrade paths that recreate or relocate destroyed tokens.

These mechanics create a **multi-state value representation**, making supply non-deterministic across layers and fragmenting the canonical total.

Many use cases — financial, cryptographic, governance-related, or long-term archival — require a model where:

- supply can *only* decrease,
- destroyed supply cannot re-enter circulation,
- and value exists strictly in one representation.

This EIP formalizes the first **irreversible, single-state fungible asset**.

## Specification

### 1. Immutable Total Supply Constraint

A ZW-Token MUST satisfy:

totalSupply_after = totalSupply_before − amountBurned

and SHALL NEVER increase beyond its historical maximum.

### 2. Burn Semantics

`burn(amount)` MUST:

- permanently destroy `amount`,
- emit a `Burn` event,
- reduce `totalSupply`,
- and MUST NOT allow re-minting under any circumstance.

### 3. No Multi-State Representation

A ZW-Token MUST NOT:

- create synthetic supply (L2 mirrors, wrapped tokens),
- allow wrapped variants that replicate supply,
- rely on representations that differ from the canonical state,
- or expose interfaces enabling supply duplication.

### 4. Privacy Layer Requirements (Optional)

If implemented, privacy features MUST:

- obfuscate transaction graph data **without creating** new value representations,
- preserve deterministic supply,
- avoid mixing pools that mint synthetic IOUs.

### 5. Required Interfaces

A ZW-Token MUST implement:

- ERC-20 (`requires: 20`)
- ERC-165 (`requires: 165`)

And MUST expose:

event Burn(address indexed from, uint256 amount);
function burn(uint256 amount) external;

### 6. Forbidden Behaviors

A ZW-Token MUST NOT:

- expose governance minting,
- allow owner-controlled supply restoration,
- include “reclaim burn” or “undo burn” functions,
- rely on supply mirrors (L2 → L1 sync tokens),
- allow supply through deposits of wrapped variants.

## Rationale

### Why irreversible supply?

Irreversible supply enforces:

- predictable on-chain economics,
- perfect transparency of value lifetime,
- and resilience against mint-based exploitation.

### Why single-state value?

When a token exists simultaneously as:

- ERC-20,
- wrapped ERC-20,
- L2 “representation”,
- bridge IOUs,

the supply becomes ambiguous.  
This standard eliminates multi-state ambiguity entirely.

### Why no synthetic privacy?

Most privacy systems mint temporary “note” tokens.  
ZW-Token forbids this.  
Privacy must not distort the supply graph.

## Backwards Compatibility

The proposal is fully compatible with existing ERC-20 tooling.

Smart contracts expecting `totalSupply()` and `transfer()` semantics remain unaffected.

Systems relying on reclaimable burns or synthetic representations are **not compatible**, by design.

## Reference Implementation

The following implementation is illustrative:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract ZWToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_)
        ERC20(name_, symbol_) {}

    function burn(uint256 amount) public {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
Security Considerations
The inability to restore burned supply eliminates governance-mint attack vectors.

Systems must ensure no external protocol introduces wrapped supply.

Bridges must treat ZW-Token as non-wrappable.

Privacy systems must not create synthetic representations.
