## Abstract

All ETH-transfers, including transactions, `CALL` and `SELFDESTRUCT` emit a log.

## Motivation

Logs are often used to track when balance changes of assets on Ethereum. Logs work for [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens, but they do not work for ETH. ETH transfers from EOAs can be read from the transaction list in the block, but ETH transfers from smart contract wallets are not automatically logged anywhere. This has already led to problems in the past, eg. early exchanges would often not properly support deposits from smart contract wallets, or only support them with a much longer delay. This EIP proposes that we automatically generate a log every time a value-transferring `CALL` or `SELFDESTRUCT` happens. We also add a similar log for transfers in transactions, so that all ETH transfers can be tracked using one mechanism.

## Specification

### ETH transfer logs

A log, identical to a LOG3, is issued for:

- Any nonzero-value-transferring transaction, before any other logs created by EVM execution
- Any nonzero-value-transferring `CALL`, at the time that the value transfer executes
- Any nonzero-value-transferring `SELFDESTRUCT` to a different account, at the time that the value transfer executes

| Field | Value |
| - | - |
| `address` emitting log | `0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe` ([`SYSTEM_ADDRESS`](./eip-4788.md)) |
| `topics[0]` | `0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef` (`keccak256('Transfer(address,address,uint256)')`) |
| `topics[1]` | `from` address (zero prefixed to fill uint256) |
| `topics[2]` | `to` address (zero prefixed to fill uint256) |
| `data` | `amount` in Wei (big endian uint256) |

This matches the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) Transfer event definition.

### Selfdestruct processing

A log, identical to a LOG2, is issued for:

- Any nonzero-value-transferring `SELFDESTRUCT` to self, at the time that the value subtraction executes
- Any nonzero-value-holding account closure, after any other logs created by EVM execution, but before charging the [EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md) priority fee, in lexicographical order of closed account address

| Field | Value |
| - | - |
| `address` emitting log | `0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe` ([`SYSTEM_ADDRESS`](./eip-4788.md)) |
| `topics[0]` | `0x4bfaba3443c1a1836cd362418edc679fc96cae8449cbefccb6457cdf2c943083` (`keccak256('Selfdestruct(address,uint256)')`) |
| `topics[1]` | Closed `contract_address` (zero prefixed to fill uint256) |
| `data` | `amount` in Wei (big endian uint256)

The Selfdestruct log is emitted when (1) a `SELFDESTRUCT` to self is triggered, or when (2) a smart contract is closed after receiving more ETH after already flagged for `SELFDESTRUCT`.

## Rationale

This is the simplest possible implementation that ensures that all ETH transfers are implemented in some kind of record that can be easily accessed through making RPC calls into a node, or through asking for a Merkle branch that is hashed into the block root. The log type is compatible with the ERC-20 token standard, but does not introduce any overly-specific ERC-20 features (eg. ABI encodings) into the specification.

### Open questions

1. Magic value used for `address`? For address: (a) `0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee` (same as `eth_simulateV1`), (b) `0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe` ([`SYSTEM_ADDRESS`](./eip-4788.md)), (c) zero address
2. Should fee payments trigger a log? It would ensure "completeness", in the sense that you can compute the exact current balance table by watching logs, but it would greatly increase the number of logs, perhaps to an unacceptably high amount.
3. Should withdrawals also trigger a log? They are not associated with transactions.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Test Cases

TODO

## Security Considerations

ETH transfers already cost a minimum of 6700 gas, which is much more expensive than the LOG3 opcode (1500 gas). Hence, this EIP does not increase the worst-case number of logs that can be put into a block. It will somewhat increase the average number of logs.
