## Abstract

This EIP proposes to add a new opcode `ASSERTTXINDEX` that reverts if the index of the current transaction within the block does not match the argument provided. This allows for conditional transactions that can only be executed at a certain index within a block.

## Motivation

The new opcode aims to improve support for encrypted mempools. Transactions in an encrypted mempool are ordered while the transactions are encrypted, before being decrypted and included onchain at the top of the block. If the builder does not respect the order when including the decrypted transactions then they could frontrun decrypted transactions. The new opcode can be used to make this impossible; if a decrypted transaction is not included in the correct order it will revert.

## Specification

If `block.timestamp >= TBD`, a new opcode `ASSERTTXINDEX` shall be created at `TBD`. It takes as an argument the specified transaction index as an offset into calldata.

### Input

Takes as input a 32 byte index into calldata.

### Behaviour

The `ASSERTTXINDEX` instruction will revert under the following conditions:

- The index of the current transaction does not match the argument provided.
- If this is not the first instruction executed in the current transaction.
- The provided argument was not a valid offset into calldata.

Otherwise it will do nothing, equivalent to a NOP instruction.

#### Stack

| Stack      | Value    |
| ---------- | -------- |
| `top - 0`  | `Index`  |

`Index` is a 4 byte uint in big endian encoding. 

### Gas Cost

The gas cost for `ASSERTTXINDEX` is a fixed fee of `2`.

## Rationale

### Assertion

An alternative design could simply return the current transaction index. The assertion approach is favoured as it means that the desired transaction index must be determined statically when the transaction is created, rather than allowing dynamic evaluation. This prevents complex constraints being imposed that makes it difficult to build a block.

Furthermore the instruction must be the first one in a transaction and take an argument from calldata, so that one can statically evaluate what the desired transaction index is.

### Gas Price

The opcode is priced to match similar opcodes in the `W_base` set.
