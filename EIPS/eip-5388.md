## Abstract

This standard introduces composable RESTful HTTP and Solidity interfaces that enable paying to access HTTP endpoints using [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) tokens.

## Motivation

According to RFC 7231, HTTP status code `402 Payment Required` is reserved for future use. But the future is now as Ethereum enables users to verify their identity with a server using public key infrastructure.

The Ethereum community has expressed the need for a composable method of token-gating HTTP endpoints. In this document, we outline a protocol implementable by HTTP servers to accept [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) payments prior to allowing access to an authorized endpoint.

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Upon the user's initial request, an HTTP server implementing token-gating via this EIP responds with a `402 Payment Required` status code:

- Its body must include a valid JSON string that complies with the Solidity Contract ABI Specification for calling contracts.
- It must include a custom header `X-EIP-5388-CONTRACT-ADDRESS` that suggests the contract's address a call must be directed to.
- It must include a custom header `X-EIP-5388-ABI-ENCODED-INPUT` that suggests the call signature the user must invoke at `X-EIP-5388-CONTRACT-ADDRESS` to gain access to the endpoint.

### Example Response

```
HTTP/2.0 402 Payment Required
Date: Mon, 01 Aug 2022 13:37:00 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
X-EIP-5388-CONTRACT-ADDRESS: 0x005241438cAF3eaCb05bB6543151f7AF894C5B58
X-EIP-5388-ABI-ENCODED-INPUT: 23b872dd00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007b

"{\"constant\":false,\"inputs\":[{\"name\":\"_from\",\"type\":\"address\"},{\"name\":\"_to\",\"type\":\"address\"},{\"name\":\"_value\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}],\"name\":\"transferFrom\",\"outputs\":[{\"name\":\"success\",\"type\":\"bool\"}],\"type\":\"function\"}"
```

### Authorization via [EIP-712](./eip-712) Signature

After successfully calling the suggested Ethereum contract with the appropriate inputs, for a user request that containing a validly signed message for endpoint authorization, the server must allow access to the bespoke endpoint.

The signature is complaint with [EIP-712](./eip-712.md):

```js
keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
  hex"1901",
  DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
  keccak256(abi.encode(
    keccak256("Invocation(address contract,string input"),
    contract,
		keccak256(bytes(input)),
  ))
))
```

where `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` must be unique to the chain to prevent replay attacks from other domains, and satisfy the requirements of [EIP-712](./eip-712.md):

```js
DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
	abi.encode(
		keccak256(
			"EIP712Domain(string version,uint256 chainId,string endpoint,string method)"
		),
		keccak256(bytes(version)),
		chainid,
		keccak256(bytes(endpoint)),
		keccak256(bytes(method))
	)
);
```

where `endpoint` must represent the full URL, e.g. `https://ethereum.org/api/v1/cutedoge` and `method` an existing HTTP method.

```js
{
  "types": {
    "EIP712Domain": [
      {
        "name": "version",
        "type": "string"
      },
      {
        "name": "chainId",
        "type": "uint256"
      },
      {
        "name": "endpoint",
        "type": "string"
      },
      {
        "name": "method",
        "type": "string"
      }
    ],
    "Invocation": [
      {
        "name": "contract",
        "type": "address"
      },
      {
        "name": "input",
        "type": "string"
      }
    ],
    "primaryType": "Invocation",
    "domain": {
      "version": version,
      "chainId": chainid,
      "endpoint": endpoint,
      "method": method
    },
    "message": {
      "contract": contract,
      "input": input
    }
  }
}
```

The resulting hexadecimal-encoded signature must be included in a user's request to the endpoint as the `Bearer` value of the `Authorization` header. An example:

```http
GET /index.html
Authorization: Bearer 0xabc...
```

Upon validating the signature and cross-checking it with the mandated on-chain interaction, a server must allow access to the appointed endpoint's resource.
