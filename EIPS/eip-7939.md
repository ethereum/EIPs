## Abstract

Introduce a new opcode, `CLZ(x)`, which pops `x` from the stack and pushes the number of leading zero bits in `x` to the stack. If `x` is zero, pushes 256.

## Motivation

Count leading zeros (CLZ) is a native opcode in many processor architectures (even in RISC architectures like ARM).

It is a basic building block used in math operations, byte operations, compression algorithms, data structures:

- lnWad
- powWad
- lambertW0Wad
- sqrt
- cbrt
- byte string comparisons
- generalized calldata compression/decompression
- bitmaps (for finding the next/previous set/unset bit)
- post quantum signature schemes

## Specification

A new opcode is introduced: `CLZ` (`0x1e`).

- Pops 1 value from the stack.
- Pushes a value to the stack, according to the following code:

```solidity
/// @dev Count leading zeros.
/// Returns the number of zeros preceding the most significant one bit.
/// If `x` is zero, returns 256.
/// This is the fastest known `clz` implementation in Solidity and uses about 184 gas.
function clz(uint256 x) internal pure returns (uint256 r) {
    /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
    assembly {
        r := shl(7, lt(0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff, x))
        r := or(r, shl(6, lt(0xffffffffffffffff, shr(r, x))))
        r := or(r, shl(5, lt(0xffffffff, shr(r, x))))
        r := or(r, shl(4, lt(0xffff, shr(r, x))))
        r := or(r, shl(3, lt(0xff, shr(r, x))))
        // forgefmt: disable-next-item
        r := add(xor(r, byte(and(0x1f, shr(shr(r, x), 0x8421084210842108cc6318c6db6d54be)),
            0xf8f9f9faf9fdfafbf9fdfcfdfafbfcfef9fafdfafcfcfbfefafafcfbffffffff)), iszero(x))
    }
}
```

Or in Python,

```python
def clz(x):
    """Returns the number of zeros preceding the most significant one bit."""
    if x < 0:
        raise ValueError("clz is undefined for negative numbers")
    if x > 2**256 - 1:
        raise ValueError("clz is undefined for numbers larger than 2**256 - 1")
    if x == 0:
        return 256
    # Convert to binary string and remove any '0b' prefix.
    bin_str = bin(x).replace('0b', '')
    return 256 - len(bin_str)
```

The cost of the opcode is 3, the same as `add`.

## Rationale

### The special 0 case

256 is the smallest number after 255. Returning a small number allows the result to be compared with minimal additional bytecode.

For byte scanning operations, one can get the number of bytes to be skipped for a zero word by simply computing `256 >> 3`, which gives 32.

### Opcode namespace conservation

Computing the least significant bit can be easily implemented with CLZ by isolating the smallest bit via `x & -x`.

### Gas cost

We have benchmarked the `clz` and `add` implementation in the intx library. `clz` uses approximately the same amount of compute cycles as `add`. 

## Backwards Compatibility

This is a new opcode not present prior.
