## Abstract

This EIP defines a migration process of existing Merkle-Patricia Trie (MPT) commitments for receipts to [Simple Serialize (SSZ)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ef434e87165e9a4c82a99f54ffd4974ae113f732/ssz/simple-serialize.md)

## Motivation

[EIP-6404](./eip-6404.md) introduces the more modern SSZ format to the `transactions_root` of the consensus `ExecutionPayloadHeader` and the execution block header. This EIP defines the equivalent transition for `receipts_root` to add support for [EIP-6493 `Receipt`](./eip-6493.md).

Note that in contrast to the `transactions_root` which refers to a Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT) root in execution but to an SSZ root in consensus, the `receipts_root` is already consistent and refers to the same MPT root. With this EIP, it will be changed to consistently refer to the same SSZ root.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Consensus `ExecutionPayload` changes

When building a consensus `ExecutionPayload`, the [`receipts_root`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ef434e87165e9a4c82a99f54ffd4974ae113f732/specs/capella/beacon-chain.md#executionpayload) is now based on the [`Receipt`](./eip-6493.md) SSZ container. [EIP-6493](./eip-6493.md) defines how RLP receipts can be converted to SSZ.

This changes the type of `receipts_root` from an MPT [`Hash32`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ef434e87165e9a4c82a99f54ffd4974ae113f732/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#custom-types) to an SSZ [`Root`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ef434e87165e9a4c82a99f54ffd4974ae113f732/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#custom-types).

```python
class ExecutionPayload(Container):
    ...
    receipts_root: Root
    ...
```

To compute the `receipts_root`, the list of individual `Receipt` containers is represented as an SSZ `List`.

| Name | Value |
| - | - |
| [`MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_PAYLOAD`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ef434e87165e9a4c82a99f54ffd4974ae113f732/specs/bellatrix/beacon-chain.md#execution) | `uint64(2**20)` (= 1,048,576) |

```python
receipts = List[Receipt, MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_PAYLOAD](
    receipt_0, receipt_1, receipt_2, ...)

payload.receipts_root = receipts.hash_tree_root()
```

### Consensus `ExecutionPayloadHeader` changes

The [consensus `ExecutionPayloadHeader`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ef434e87165e9a4c82a99f54ffd4974ae113f732/specs/capella/beacon-chain.md#executionpayloadheader) is updated to match the new `ExecutionPayload.receipts_root` definition.

```python
class ExecutionPayloadHeader(Container):
    ...
    receipts_root: Root
    ...
```

```python
payload_header.receipts_root = payload.receipts_root
```

### Execution block header changes

The [execution block header's `receipts-root`](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/6b259a7003b4bfb18365ba690f4b00ba8a26393b/caps/eth.md#block-encoding-and-validity) is updated to match the consensus `ExecutionPayloadHeader.receipts_root`.

## Rationale

This change enables the use of SSZ transactions as defined in [EIP-6493](./eip-6493.md).

## Backwards Compatibility

Applications that rely on the replaced MPT `receipts_root` in the block header require migration to the SSZ `receipts_root`.
