## Abstract

This EIP defines a migration process of existing Merkle-Patricia Trie (MPT) commitments for receipts to Simple Serialize (SSZ).

## Motivation

While the consensus `ExecutionPayloadHeader` and the execution block header map to each other conceptually, they are encoded differently. This EIP aims to align the encoding of the `receipts_root`, taking advantage of the more modern SSZ format. This brings several advantages:

1. **Reducing complexity:** Merkle-Patricia Tries (MPT) are hard to work with. Replacing them with SSZ leaves only the state trie in the legacy MPT format.

2. **Better for smart contracts:** The SSZ format is optimized for production and verification of merkle proofs. It allows proving specific fields of containers and allows chunked processing.

3. **Better for light clients:** Light clients with access to the consensus `ExecutionPayloadHeader` no longer need to implement Merkle-Patricia Trie or RLP libraries to work with receipts.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Consensus `ExecutionPayload` changes

A new `Receipt` SSZ container is introduced to represent receipts.

| Name | SSZ equivalent |
| - | - |
| `Topic` | `Bytes32` |
| [`TransactionType`](./eip-6404.md) | `uint8` |

| Name | Value | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| [`BYTES_PER_LOGS_BLOOM`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/67c2f9ee9eb562f7cc02b2ff90d92c56137944e1/specs/bellatrix/beacon-chain.md#execution) | `uint64(2**8)` (= 256) | Fixed constant |
| `MAX_TOPICS_PER_LOG` | `uint64(2**2)` (= 4) | `LOG0` through `LOG4` opcodes allow 0-4 topics per log |
| `MAX_LOG_DATA_SIZE` | `uint64(2**24)` (= 16,777,216) | Recommended devp2p soft limit for entire receipt: [2 MiB](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/bd17dac4228c69b6379644355f373669f74952cd/caps/eth.md#receipts-0x10) |
| `MAX_LOGS_PER_RECEIPT` | `uint64(2**20)` (= 1,048,576) | Same scaling factor as [`MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_PAYLOAD`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/67c2f9ee9eb562f7cc02b2ff90d92c56137944e1/specs/bellatrix/beacon-chain.md#execution) |

```python
class ReceiptLog(Container):
    address: Address
    topics: List[Topic, MAX_TOPICS_PER_LOG]
    data: ByteVector[MAX_LOG_DATA_SIZE]

class Receipt(Container):
    status: uint256  # EIP-658
    cumulative_transaction_gas_used: uint64
    logs_bloom: ByteVector[BYTES_PER_LOGS_BLOOM]
    logs: List[ReceiptLog, MAX_LOGS_PER_RECEIPT]

class TypedReceipt(Container):
    tx_type: TransactionType
    payload: Receipt
```

The [consensus `ExecutionPayload`'s `receipts_root`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/67c2f9ee9eb562f7cc02b2ff90d92c56137944e1/specs/capella/beacon-chain.md#executionpayload) now refers to an SSZ [`Root`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/67c2f9ee9eb562f7cc02b2ff90d92c56137944e1/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#custom-types) instead of an MPT [`Hash32`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/67c2f9ee9eb562f7cc02b2ff90d92c56137944e1/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#custom-types).

```python
class ExecutionPayload(Container):
    ...
    receipts_root: Root
    ...
```

To compute the new `receipts_root`, the list of individual `TypedReceipt` containers is represented as a SSZ `List`.

```python
payload.receipts_root = hash_tree_root(List[TypedReceipt, MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_PAYLOAD](
    receipt_0,
    receipt_1,
    receipt_2,
    ...
))
```

### Consensus `ExecutionPayloadHeader` changes

The [consensus `ExecutionPayloadHeader`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/67c2f9ee9eb562f7cc02b2ff90d92c56137944e1/specs/capella/beacon-chain.md#executionpayloadheader) is updated for the new `ExecutionPayload.receipts_root` definition.

```python
class ExecutionPayloadHeader(Container):
    ...
    receipts_root: Root
    ...
```

```python
payload_header.receipts_root = payload.receipts_root
```

### Execution block header changes

The [execution block header's `receipts-root`](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/bd17dac4228c69b6379644355f373669f74952cd/caps/eth.md#block-encoding-and-validity) is updated to match the consensus `ExecutionPayloadHeader.receipts_root`.

### Helpers

These helpers use `TransactionType` constants as defined in [EIP-6404](./eip-6404.md).

```python
def encode_receipt(receipt: TypedReceipt) -> bytes:
    schema = (
        (big_endian_int, receipt.status),
        (big_endian_int, receipt.cumulative_transaction_gas_used),
        (Binary[256, 256], receipt.logs_bloom),
        (List([Binary[20, 20], List([Binary[32, 32]]), Binary[0, uint64(2**24)]]), [
            (log.address, log.topics, log.data) for log in receipt.logs
        ]),
    )
    sedes = List([schema for schema, _ in schema])
    values = [value for _, value in schema]
    encoded = rlp.encode(values, sedes)

    if receipt.tx_type == TRANSACTION_TYPE_EIP4844:
        return [0x05] + encoded
    if receipt.tx_type == TRANSACTION_TYPE_EIP1559:
        return [0x02] + encoded
    if receipt.tx_type == TRANSACTION_TYPE_EIP2930:
        return [0x01] + encoded
    if receipt.tx_type == TRANSACTION_TYPE_LEGACY:
        return encoded
    assert False
```

```python
def decode_receipt(encoded_receipt: bytes) -> Receipt:
    eip2718_type = encoded_receipt[0]

    class RLPReceipt(rlp.Serializable):
        fields = (
            ('status', big_endian_int),
            ('cumulative_transaction_gas_used', big_endian_int),
            ('logs_bloom', Binary[256, 256]),
            ('logs', List([Binary[20, 20], List([Binary[32, 32]]), Binary[0, uint64(2**24)]])),
        )
    if eip2718_type == 0x05:
        tx_type = TRANSACTION_TYPE_EIP4844
        pre = RLPReceipt.deserialize(encoded_receipt[1:])
    elif eip2718_type == 0x02:
        tx_type = TRANSACTION_TYPE_EIP1559
        pre = RLPReceipt.deserialize(encoded_receipt[1:])
    elif eip2718_type == 0x01:
        tx_type = TRANSACTION_TYPE_EIP2930
        pre = RLPReceipt.deserialize(encoded_receipt[1:])
    elif 0xc0 <= eip2718_type <= 0xfe:
        tx_type = TRANSACTION_TYPE_LEGACY
        pre = RLPReceipt.deserialize(encoded_receipt)
    else:
        assert False

    return Receipt(
        status=pre.status,
        cumulative_transaction_gas_used=pre.cumulative_transaction_gas_used,
        logs_bloom=pre.logs_bloom,
        logs=[ReceiptLog(
            address=log[0],
            topics=log[1],
            data=log[2],
        ) for log in pre.logs],
    )
```

## Rationale

This aligns the receipt representation with the [EIP-6404](./eip-6404.md) transaction representation.

### What about `ReceiptLog` data?

`ReceiptLog` data is formatted according to the Ethereum contract ABI. Merkleizing log data according to its original structure would be more useful than merkleizing it as a `ByteVector`. However, the data structure is determined by the log event signature, of which only the hash is known. As the hash preimages are erased from emitted EVM logs, it is not reliably possible to recover the original log event signature. Therefore, log data is provided as a `ByteVector` for now, with the option for a future EIP to extend it.

## Backwards Compatibility

Applications that solely rely on the `TypedReceipt` RLP encoding but do not rely on the `receipts_root` commitment in the block header can still be used through a re-encoding proxy.

Applications that rely on the replaced MPT `receipts_root` in the block header can no longer find that information.

Receipts are tied to transactions, so are typically tied to either the transaction hash, or to a block hash + sequential transaction index. At time of writing, there is no JSON-RPC endpoint to obtain a receipts proof. It is not expected that major applications rely on the Merkle-Patricia Trie commitment for receipts.
