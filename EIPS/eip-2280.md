## Simple Summary

Use ERC-712 signatures to trigger `transfer`, `transferFrom` or `approve` methods on an ERC-20 token.

## Motivation

The popularity of meta transactions is rising thanks to actors of the community (Austin Thomas Griffith, the MetaCartel, and many more). ERC-1776 was published in February 2019 by Ronan Sandford to start a standardization process around implementations of native meta transactions as extensions of well-known standards. I introduce today the specification for an ERC-20 (only) extension adding native meta transactions support; the **ERC-2280** standard. This standard should focus on simplicity, and is a major step in the development of standardized relay networks.

### Goal

- Create a standard for wallets and web3 browsers to properly understand these types of signatures and adapt their UI
- Create a standard for Relays to properly integrate any new tokens following the standard

### Example Use Cases

- **Transfer Tokens without paying for ETH gas**: this a better practice than giving eth to your users so they can make the transactions.
- **Pay for gas with the token**: the procotol supports a reward argument that redirects funds to the relayer when signature is properly uploaded.
- **Make your tokens $ETH independent**: Setup a network of relayers (accounts that want to submit signatures for you in exchange of the reward) and the token users will never have to buy ETH to use your tokens.

## Abstract

The following standard describe a set of functions to trigger the `transfer`, `approve` and `transferFrom` mechanism with meta transactions. It introduces 7 new functions:

- `signedTransfer` & its verifier `verifyTransfer` take the same arguments. The first one is a state-modifying method while the latter is a constant method meant for argument / signature verification.

- `signedApprove` & its verifier `verifyApprove` take the same arguments. The first one is a state-modifying method while the latter is a constant method meant for argument / signature verification.

- `signedTransferFrom` & its verifier `verifyTransferFrom` take the same arguments. The first one is a state-modifying method while the latter is a constant method meant for argument / signature verification.

- `nonceOf` is a constant method used to retrieve the current nonce of an account.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### EIP-712 Types

#### EIP712Domain

This mandatory type MUST be included in the signed payload.

```solidity

    struct EIP712Domain {
        string  name;
        string  version;
        uint256 chainId;
        address verifyingContract;
    }

```

#### mActors

This type describes the extra actors involved in the meta transaction: the **Signer** and the **Relayer**. 

```solidity

    struct mActors {
        address signer;  // Used to check signature validity
        address relayer; // Used to enforce a relayer address. Set to address(0) if no restrictions required
    }

```

#### mTxParams

This type describes transaction parameters & reward parameters.

```solidity

    struct mTxParams {
        uint256 nonce;    // Nonce of the Signer
        uint256 gasLimit; // Wanted gas limit
        uint256 gasPrice; // Wanted gas price
        uint256 reward;   // Amount of token provided as reward to the relayer
    }

```

#### mTransfer

This types describe the main type used to trigger a `transfer`.

```solidity

    struct mTransfer {
        address recipient; // Destination address of the transfer
        uint256 amount;    // Token amount to transfer
        mActors actors;
        mTxParams txparams;
    }

```

#### mApprove

This type describe the main type used to trigger an `approve`.

```solidity

    struct mApprove {
        address spender; // Target address that would benefit from the approval
        uint256 amount;  // Amount of token that the address can manipulate
        mActors actors;
        mTxParams txparams;
    }

```

#### mTransferFrom

This type describe the main type used to trigger a `transferFrom`.

```solidity

    struct mTransferFrom {
        address sender;    // Balance that transfers the tokens
        address recipient; // Destination of the transfer
        uint256 amount;    // Amount to move from sender to recipient
        mActors actors;
        mTxParams txparams;
    }

```

### ERC2280 interface

#### `nonceOf`

```solidity
    function nonceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
```

##### Notes

The nonce is used to prevent attackers from organizing replay attacks.

##### Main Mechanism

Return the current expected nonce for given `account`.

#### `verifyTransfer`

```solidity
    function verifyTransfer(
        address[3] calldata actors, uint256[5] calldata txparams, bytes calldata signature
    ) external view returns (bool);
```

## Rationale

The specification was designed with simplicity in mind, and respect to current tools and standards (EIP-712, ERC-165). The 7 new methods can be divided into 4 categories.

1. `nonceOf` is the newcomer. This constant method is required to give a nonce to the signers and prevent replay attacks.

2. `verifyTransfer` and `signedTransfer` accept `recipient` in the `actors` argument and `amount` in the `txparams` argument.

2. `verifyApprove` and `signedApprove` accept `spender` in the `actors` argument and `amount` in the `txparams` argument.

2. `verifyTransferFrom` and `signedTransferFrom` accept `sender` and `recipient` in the `actors` argument and `amount` in the `txparams` argument.

The `mActors` and `mTxParams` type have been introduced to factorize arguments in two logical types. Multiple meta-transactions could get packed into the arrays in that way.

The `signature` is a `bytes` argument, making it easier to use as most off-chain tools and implementations return hex strings or buffers as results of ECDSA.

#### Splitting bytes signature into `r`, `s` & `v`

To lower the amount of arguments for the call, we prefer taking the signature as a `bytes` argument. This functions splits the given `bytes` into `uint8 v`, `bytes32 r` and `bytes32 s`.

```solidity

    function _splitSignature(bytes memory signature) private pure returns (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) {
        require(signature.length == 65, "Invalid signature length");

        assembly {
            r := mload(add(signature, 32))
            s := mload(add(signature, 64))
            v := and(mload(add(signature, 65)), 255)
        }

        if (v < 27) {
            v += 27;
        }

        require(v == 27 || v == 28, "Invalid v argument");
    }

```

#### Build the EIP-712 Domain

In order to verify the signatures, the `ERC-2280` compliant contract should use the following method:

- Define the types as structs (`EIP712Domain`, `mActors`, `mTxParams`, `mTransfer`, `mApprove`, `mTransferFrom`).
- Define a `hash` helper function with parametric polymorphism for each type defined above.
- Define a `verify` helper function with parametric polymorphism for each type defined above that is going to be signed (only `mTransfer`, `mApprove` and `mTransferFrom`).

The EIP712Domain should always have the following values for your implementation:

- `name` should be the same as the one returned by the `name` method from the `ERC20` optional specification.
- `version` should be defined as you want.
- `chainId` should be the proper ID of the current chain.
- `verifyingContract` should be the address of the `ERC-2280 contract (`address(this)`).

This is an example implementation of the `ERC2280Domain`, that can also be found [here](https://github.com/ticket721/erc2280/blob/master/contracts/ERC2280Domain.sol).

### Off-Chain

#### Generate proper EIP-712 signatures with [`@ticket721/e712`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ticket721/e712) in Javascript / Typescript

The [`@ticket721/e712`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ticket721/e712) npm module can be used to properly generate signatures to make the calls. 

Complete usage examples of `signedTransfer`, `signedApprove`, `signedTransferFrom`, `verifyTransfer`, `verifyApprove` and `verifyTransferFrom` can be found in the [example implementation tests](https://github.com/ticket721/erc2280/blob/master/test/mtkn.js).

The module exposes a helper class, `ERC2280Signer`. Build it with your domain arguments and quickly generate signatures with your private key, or payloads for your web3 browser. You can also verify proofs.

##### Example: with private key available

```typescript
import { ERC2280Signer, EIP712Signature }    from '@ticket721/e712';
import { Wallet }                         from 'ethers';
import { BN }                             from 'bn.js';

const domain_name = 'my ERC2280';
const domain_version = '1';
const domain_chain_id = 1;
const domain_contract = '0xd0a21D06befee2C5851EbafbcB1131d35B135e87';

const transfer_recipient = '0x19C8239E04ceA1B1C0342E6da5cF3a5Ca54874e1';
const address_zero = '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000';


// Build helper class
const ERC2280 = new ERC2280Signer(domain_name, domain_version, domain_chain_id, domain_contract);

// Use your own private keys
const wallet = Wallet.createRandom();

// Generate proof
const sig: EIP712Signature = await ERC2280.transfer(transfer_recipient, new BN(1000), {
    signer: wallet.address,
    relayer: address_zero
}, {
    nonce: new BN(0),
    gasLimit: new BN(1000000),
    gasPrice: 1000000,
    reward: 500
}, wallet.privateKey) as EIP712Signature;

// Verify proofs
const verification = await ERC2280.verifyTransfer(transfer_recipient, new BN(1000), {
    signer: wallet.address,
    relayer: address_zero
}, {
    nonce: new BN(0),
    gasLimit: new BN(1000000),
    gasPrice: 1000000,
    reward: 500
}, sig.hex);

```

##### Example: sign with web3 browser

```typescript
import { ERC2280Signer, EIP712Payload }    from '@ticket721/e712';

### Implementations

- Working example implementation [here](https://github.com/ticket721/erc2280/blob/master/contracts/mTKN.sol) with tests [here](https://github.com/ticket721/erc2280/blob/master/test/mtkn.js).

### History

- Vitalik discussing it on ethresear.ch (https://ethresear.ch/t/layer-2-gas-payment-abstraction/4513).
- Austin Thomas Griffith implementation on github (https://github.com/austintgriffith/native-meta-transactions).
- ERC-865 (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/865).
- ERC-965 (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/965).
- ERC-1776 Native Meta Transactions (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1776).

### Discussion

My goal is to make a specification that can get broadly adopted in order to start working on relay networks for `ERC2280` implementations. There is no point in developing these relays if I'm the only one agreeing with this spec. So please, help this standard come to life by giving your point of view, ideas and remarks [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2281).
