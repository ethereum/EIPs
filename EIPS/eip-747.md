## Abstract

This EIP standardizes a new wallet-scoped RPC method, `wallet_watchAsset`, to allow a client to suggest a token for the user's wallet to track.

## Motivation

Today, one of the major uses of Ethereum wallets is to track users' assets.
Without this EIP, each wallet either needs to pre-load a list of approved assets, or users must manually add assets to their wallet.
In the first case, wallets are burdened with both the security of managing this list, as well as the bandwidth of mass polling for known assets on their wallet.
In the second case, the user experience is terrible.

## Specification

A new RPC method, `wallet_watchAsset` is added. `wallet_watchAsset` requests that a specified asset be added to the user's wallet. It returns `true` if the asset was successfully added, or errors if it was not. The meaning of "added to the user's wallet" is dependent on the wallet implementation. A successful call to `wallet_watchAsset` should indicate that the specified asset is listed in the user's wallet (regardless of whether it already was listed).

### `wallet_watchAsset` Parameters

The `wallet_watchAsset` method takes a single parameter, a `WatchAssetParameters` object, which is defined as follows:

```typescript
interface WatchAssetParameters {
  type: string; // The asset's interface, e.g. 'ERC20'
  options: {
    address: string; // The hexadecimal Ethereum address of the token contract
    symbol?: string; // A ticker symbol or shorthand, up to 5 alphanumerical characters
    decimals?: number; // The number of asset decimals
    image?: string; // A string url of the token logo
  };
}
```

The `type` string should be the commonly accepted name of the interface implemented by the asset's contract, e.g. `ERC20`. Defining the global identifiers for different asset types is beyond the scope of this EIP. The `options` object should contain the following fields: `address`, `symbol`, `decimals`, and `image`. `address` is required, and the other fields are optional. `address` should be the hexadecimal Ethereum address of the token contract. `symbol` is a ticker symbol or shorthand, up to 5 alphanumerical characters. `decimals` is the number of asset decimals. `image` is a string url of the token logo. The following image formats must be supported:

- GIF
- PNG
- JPG/JPEG
- SVG

If the resolved image is a bitmap, its dimensions should not exceed 512x512 pixels. Neither the URI nor the image it resolves to should have a size larger than 256kb.

This interface should be extended or modified depending on the asset `type`. These changes must be specified in a separate EIP.

### `wallet_watchAsset` Returns

`wallet_watchAsset` returns the boolean value `true` if the the asset was added successfully, and an error otherwise. An error might occur in the following cases (but is not limited to these cases):

- The user declines the request
- The asset type is unrecognized/unsupported
- Downloading the image failed to load

## Rationale

Displaying a user's assets is a basic feature that every modern dapp user expects. However, keeping this list, and polling for it from the network can be costly, especially on bandwidth constrained devices.

Most wallets today either manage their own assets list, which they store client side, or they query a centralized API for balances, which reduces decentralization, letting that API's owner easily correlate account holders with their IP addresses.

Maintaining one of these assets lists becomes a political act, and maintainers can be subject to regular harassment and pressure to list otherwise unknown assets.

Furthermore, automatically listing assets makes assets into a sort of spam mail: Users suddenly seeing new assets that they don't care about in their wallet can be used to bombard them with information that they didn't opt into.

This phenomenon is exacerbated by the trend towards airdropped tokens, which has been a cause of network congestion, because spamming people with new tokens has so far been rewarded with user attention.

While some people might suggest we begin a TCR of trusted tokens to watch, this would not solve the client-side bandwidth issues, nor the airdropped token spam issues. What we really want is a small list of tokens the user cares about.

Most of the time a user is adding a asset, they learned about it on a website. At that moment, there is a natural alignment of interests, where the website wants the user to track their asset, and the user wants to track it. This is a natural point to introduce an API to easily allow these parties to collaborate, without involving the politics of the wallet's developers.

## Test Cases

In the case of assets of type `ERC20`, this method works as follows.

```javascript
ethereum.request({
  method: 'wallet_watchAsset',
  params: {
    type: 'ERC20',
    options: {
      address: '0xb60e8dd61c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07233155',
      symbol: 'FOO',
      decimals: 18,
      image: 'https://foo.io/token-image.svg',
    },
  },
});
  .then((success) => {
    if (success) {
      console.log('FOO successfully added to wallet!')
    } else {
      throw new Error('Something went wrong.')
    }
  })
  .catch(console.error)
```

Upon calling this request, the user must be prompted with the opportunity to add this token to their wallet:

## Security Considerations

### SSRF

Wallets should be careful about making arbitrary requests to URLs. As such, it is recommended for wallets to sanitize the URI by whitelisting specific schemes and ports. A vulnerable wallet could be tricked into, for example, modifying data on a locally-hosted redis database.
