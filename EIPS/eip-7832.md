## Simple Summary

This proposal defines a standardized format for representing decentralized social media posts as tokens, compatible with both ERC-721 and ERC-1155, and introduces a flexible model where the meaning of a post (original, reply, repost) is derived from its metadata rather than separate functions or event types. Additionally, it provides a mechanism to edit existing posts through an `editPost` function and an `EditPostEvent`.

## Abstract

We introduce a generic token standard to represent social media posts on-chain, allowing:

1. Representation as ERC-721 or ERC-1155 tokens.
2. A single posting mechanism: `createPost`.
3. Interpretation of post type (original, reply, repost) via the presence of certain tags in the metadata rather than separate functions or events.
4. The ability to edit previously published posts with an `editPost` function and corresponding `EditPostEvent`.
5. Multiple media attachments and external references through flexible tags.
6. NFT metadata aligned with common NFT practices, including a descriptive `name` and a `description` identical to the post’s content.

## Motivation

By eliminating separate functions or events for different post types, this standard simplifies the interface and makes the contract more extensible. Developers and clients can determine post type from the metadata. The introduction of `editPost` addresses a common user need: correcting typos, updating references, or adding clarifications after a post is published.

## Specification

### Post Structure

Each post includes:

- **id:** A unique, deterministic identifier for the post.
- **author:** The on-chain address of the post creator.
- **created_at:** Timestamp of creation (e.g., block timestamp at minting).
- **kind:** An integer representing the post category.
- **tags:** Arrays of arrays of strings that describe attachments, references, and other metadata.
  - For example, `["e", "<id_of_referenced_post>"]` could indicate a reply.
  - `["m", "<media_url>", "<mime_type>"]` indicates attached media.
  - `["r", "<URL>"]` references an external URL.
  - `["ch", "<chain_id>"]`, `["c", "<contract_address>"]` for cross-chain/contract references.
- **content:** The textual content of the post.

All these fields are stored in the NFT’s metadata under `properties`. The `description` field of the NFT is identical to `content`. The `name` field includes the author and optionally the platform, formatted as `"<author> via <platform> as Social Post"` or `"<author> as Social Post"` if no platform is specified.

### Token Standards Compatibility

- **ERC-721:** Each post is a unique NFT (`tokenId`).
- **ERC-1155:** A `tokenId` can represent one post event, potentially minted multiple times. The `id` ensures a unique reference to the event data.

### Events

#### PostEvent

When a new post is created:

```solidity
event PostEvent(
    address indexed author,
    uint256 indexed tokenId,
    bytes32 indexed id,
    bytes32 pubkey,
    uint256 created_at,
    uint32 kind,
    string content,
    string[][] tags
);
