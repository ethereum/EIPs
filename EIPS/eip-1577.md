## Abstract

This EIP introduces the new `contenthash` field for ENS resolvers, allowing for a better defined system of mapping names to network and content addresses. Additionally the `content` and `multihash` fields are deprecated.

## Motivation

Multiple applications including [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) and mobile clients such as [Status](https://status.im) have begun resolving ENS names to content hosted on distributed systems such as [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Swarm](https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io). Due to the various ways content can be stored and addressed, a standard is required so these applications know how to resolve names and that domain owners know how their content will be resolved.

The `contenthash` field allows for easy specification of network and content addresses in ENS.

## Specification

The field `contenthash` is introduced, which permits a wide range of protocols to be supported by ENS names. Resolvers supporting this field MUST return `true` when the `supportsInterface` function is called with argument `0xbc1c58d1`.

The fields `content` and `multihash` are deprecated.

The value returned by `contenthash` MUST be represented as a machine-readable [multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec). The format is specified as follows:

```
<protoCode uvarint><value []byte>
```

protoCodes and their meanings are specified in the [ensdomains/multicodec](https://github.com/ensdomains/multicodec) repository.

The encoding of the value depends on the content type specified by the protoCode; for instance, types in the range 0x00-0xf0 are encoded using [multihash](https://github.com/multiformats/multihash), meaning their value is formatted as follows:

```
<varint hash function code><varint digest size in bytes><hash function output>
```

When resolving a `contenthash`, applications MUST use the protocol code to determine what type of address is encoded, and resolve the address appropriately for that protocol, if supported.

### Example

Input data:
```
storage system: IPFS (0x01)
hash function: sha2-256 (0x12)
hash length: 32 bytes (0x20)
hash: 29f2d17be6139079dc48696d1f582a8530eb9805b561eda517e22a892c7e3f1f
```

Binary format:

```
0x01122029f2d17be6139079dc48696d1f582a8530eb9805b561eda517e22a892c7e3f1f
```

Text format:

```
/ipfs/QmRAQB6YaCyidP37UdDnjFY5vQuiBrcqdyoW1CuDgwxkD4
```

### Fallback

In order to support names that have an IPFS or Swarm hash in their `content` field, a grace period MUST be implemented offering those name holders time to update their names. If a resolver does not support the `multihash` interface, it MUST be checked whether they support the `content` interface. If they do, the value of that field SHOULD be treated in a context dependent fashion and resolved. This condition MUST be enforced until December 31st, 2018.

### Implementation

To support `contenthash`, a new resolver has been developed and can be found [here](https://github.com/ensdomains/resolvers/blob/master/contracts/PublicResolver.sol), which has been deployed at [0xd3ddccdd3b25a8a7423b5bee360a42146eb4baf3](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd3ddccdd3b25a8a7423b5bee360a42146eb4baf3)
