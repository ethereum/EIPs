## Simple Summary
Add basefee field to `eth_getBlockByHash` RPC endpoint response.

## Abstract
Adds `baseFee` property to the `eth_getBlockByHash` JSON-RPC request `result` object.  This property will contain the value of the base fee for any block after the EIP-1559 fork.

## Motivation
[EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md) introduces a base fee per gas in protocol.
This value is maintained under consensus as a new field in the block header structure.
Users may need value of the base fee at a given block. Base fee value is important to make gas price predictions more accurate.

## Specification

### `eth_getBlockByHash`

#### Description

Returns information about a block specified by hash.
Every block returned by this endpoint whose block number is before the [EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md) fork block **MUST NOT** include a `baseFee` field.
Every block returned by this endpoint whose block number is on or after the [EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md) fork block **MUST** include a `baseFee` field.

#### Parameters

Parameters remain unchanged.

#### Returns
For the full specification of `eth_getBlockByHash` see [EIP-1474](./eip-1474.md).
Add a new JSON field to the `result` object for block headers containing a base fee (post [EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md) fork block).

- {[`Quantity`](./eip-1474.md#quantity)} `baseFee` - base fee for this block

#### Example

```sh
# Request
curl -X POST --data '{

}
```

## Rationale
The addition of a single parameter instead of introducing a whole new endpoint was the simplest change that would be easiest to get integrated.
For backward compatibility we decided to not include the base fee in the response for pre-1559 blocks.  

## Backwards Compatibility
Backwards compatible. Calls related to block prior to [EIP-1559](./eip-1559.md) fork block will omit the base fee field in the response.

## Security Considerations
The added field (`baseFee`) is informational and does not introduce technical security issues.
