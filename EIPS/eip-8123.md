## Abstract

This EIP specifies a new Ethereum JSON-RPC method, `eth_txGasLimitCap`, which returns the maximum transaction gas limit
(`tx.gas`) that the node will accept under the current fork rules (and any stricter local policy). This enables wallets,
SDKs, bundlers, and tooling to discover the effective per-transaction gas limit cap without simulation or out-of-band
knowledge.

## Motivation

[EIP-7825](./eip-7825.md) introduces a protocol-level per-transaction gas limit cap (e.g. `2^24 = 16,777,216` on Ethereum) to bound
worst-case single-transaction work. However, it does not specify any way to query this cap.

As a consequence, users and tools must:

- infer it from failed transaction submissions,
- hardcode network assumptions,
- read client source code,
- or rely on Internet documentation.

This is brittle because:

- the cap may change in future upgrades,
- different chains intentionally set different cap values (e.g. Arbitrum and Polygon both use `32,000,000`),
- and there already are some proposals to make the transaction gas limit cap dynamic, rather than hardcoded, based on new
  fee calculation rules

## Specification

The key words “MUST", “MUST NOT", “SHOULD", and “MAY" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### New method: `eth_txGasLimitCap`

#### Request

- **Method**: `eth_txGasLimitCap`
- **Params**: `[]` (no parameters)

#### Response

- **Result**: `QUANTITY` or `null`
  - If the node enforces a finite transaction gas limit cap, it **MUST** return that cap as a `QUANTITY`.
  - If the node does not enforce a finite cap, it **MUST** return `null`.

Returning `null` indicates that no finite per-transaction gas limit is enforced by the node.

#### Semantics

Let:

- `protocolCap` be the maximum `tx.gas` permitted by the active protocol rules at the node's current head (e.g. from
  EIP-7825 when enabled).
- `policyCap` be any stricter local cap applied by the node to transaction acceptance (e.g. txpool admission), if
  configured; otherwise, unbounded.

Then the node **MUST** return:

- `min(protocolCap, policyCap)` if finite, else `null`.

A node **MUST NOT** return a value higher than the protocol cap when the protocol cap is finite.

#### Example

Ethereum (EIP-7825 cap = `2^24`):

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "eth_txGasLimitCap", "params": [] }
```

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": "0x1000000" }
```

A chain with a `32,000,000` cap:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "result": "0x1e84800" }
```

## Rationale

A dedicated method is needed because there is currently no way to query the maximum allowed `tx.gas` without simulation
or out-of-band knowledge.

Returning the _effective_ cap (`min(protocolCap, policyCap)`) matches what users need when constructing transactions to
submit.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP adds a new JSON-RPC method and does not modify existing methods. Existing clients and applications remain
compatible.

## Reference Implementation

Pseudo code:

```text
if protocol has finite tx gas cap at head:
  protocolCap = that value
else:
  protocolCap = +infinity

if protocol has policy cap:
  policyCap = that value
else:
  policyCap = +infinity

cap = min(protocolCap, policyCap)

if cap is finite:
  return cap
else:
  return null
```

## Security Considerations

This EIP only exposes information that is already public or otherwise observable by probing. It does not expose secrets
or user data.
