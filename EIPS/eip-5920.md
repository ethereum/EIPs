## Abstract

This EIP introduces a new opcode, `PAY`, taking two stack parameters, `addr` and `val`, that transfers `val` wei to the address `addr` without calling any of its functions.

## Motivation

Currently, to send ether to an address requires you to call into that address, which transfers execution context to that address, which creates several issues:

- First of all, it opens a reentrancy attack vector, as the recipient can call back into the sender. More generally, the recipient can unilaterally execute arbitrary state changes, limited only by the gas stipend, which is not desirable from the point of view of the sender.
- Secondly, it opens a DoS vector. Contracts which want to send ether must be cognizant of the possibility that the recipient will run out of gas or revert.
- Finally, the `CALL` opcode is needlessly expensive for simple ether transfers, as it requires the memory and stack to be expanded, the recipient's full data including code and memory to be loaded, and finally needs to execute a call, which might do other unintentional operations. Having a dedicated opcode for ether transfers solves all of these issues, and would be a useful addition to the EVM.

## Specification

### Constants

| Constant                   | Definition                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `WARM_STORAGE_READ_COST`   | [EIP-2929](./eip-2929.md) |
| `COLD_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_COST` | [EIP-2929](./eip-2929.md) |
| `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT`          | [EELS][gna]               |
| `GAS_CALL_VALUE`           | [EELS][gcv]               |

### Behavior

A new opcode is introduced: `PAY` (`0xf9`), which:

- Pops two values from the stack: `addr` then `val`.
- Transfers `val` wei from the current target address to the address `addr`.
- Marks `addr` as warm (adding `addr` to `accessed_addresses`.)

### Gas Cost

The gas cost for `PAY` is the sum of the following:

- Is `addr` in `accessed_addresses`?
    - If yes, `WARM_STORAGE_READ_COST`;
    - Otherwise, `COLD_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_COST`.
- Does `addr` exist or is `val` zero?
    - If yes to either, zero;
    - Otherwise, `GAS_NEW_ACCOUNT`.
- Is `val` zero?
    - If yes, zero;
    - Otherwise, `GAS_CALL_VALUE`.

`PAY` cannot be implemented on networks with empty accounts (see [EIP-7523](./eip-7523.md).)

## Rationale

### Argument order

The order of arguments mimics that of `CALL`, which pops `addr` before `val`. Beyond consistency, though, this ordering aids validators pattern-matching MEV opportunities, so `PAY` always appears immediately after `COINBASE`.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change requires a hard fork.

## Security Considerations

Existing contracts should not rely on their balance being under their control, since it is already possible to send ether to an address without calling it, by creating a temporary contract and immediately `SELFDESTRUCT`ing it, sending the ether to an arbitrary address. However, this opcode does make this process cheaper for already-vulnerable contracts.
