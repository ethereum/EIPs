## Abstract

This proposal brings standardization between block explorers API routes when linking transactions, blocks, accounts and tokens. 

## Motivation

Currently wallets and dapps link transactions and accounts to block explorer web pages but as chain diversity and layer two solutions grow it becomes harder to maintain a consistent user experience. Adding new chains or layer two solutions becomes harder given these endpoints are inconsistent. Standardizing the API routes to these links improves interoperability between wallets and block explorers.

## Specification

Block explorers will route their webpages accordingly for the following data:

### Blocks

`<BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL>/block/<BLOCK_HASH_OR_HEIGHT>`

### Transactions

`<BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL>/tx/<TX_HASH>`

### Accounts

`<BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL>/address/<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>`

### Tokens

`<BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL>/token/<TOKEN_ADDRESS>`

## Rationale

The particular paths used in this proposal are chosen to be compatible with the majority of existing block explorers.

## Backwards Compatibility

Incompatible block explorers can use redirects to their existing API routes in order to conform to this EIP.

## Security Considerations

None
