## Abstract

This meta-EIP specifies the changes included in the Ethereum hardfork that removes [EIP-1283](./eip-1283.md) from [Constantinople](./eip-1013.md).

## Specification

- Codename: Petersburg
- Aliases: St. Petersfork, Peter's Fork, Constantinople Fix
- Activation:
  - `Block >= 7_280_000` on the Ethereum mainnet
  - `Block >= 4_939_394` on the Ropsten testnet
  - `Block >= 10_255_201` on the Kovan testnet
  - `Block >= 9_999_999` on the Rinkeby testnet
  - `Block >= 0` on the Görli testnet
- Removed EIPs:
  - [EIP 1283](./eip-1283.md): Net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty maps

If `Petersburg` and `Constantinople` are applied at the same block, `Petersburg` takes precedence: with the net effect of EIP-1283 being _disabled_.

If `Petersburg` is defined with an earlier block number than `Constantinople`, then there is _no immediate effect_ from the `Petersburg` fork. However, when `Constantinople` is later activated, EIP-1283 should be _disabled_.
