## Abstract
A vanilla non-fungible token standard proposed by [EIP-3754](./eip-3754.md)
together with the established **unicode** system can create an on-chain language
system particularly valuable for representing logographic characters. Examples
include _hanzi_ in Mandarin, _kanji_ in Japanese, _hanja_ in Korean, and etc.
On-chain chatting, blogs, micro-blogs systems can be built for communities using
such languages.

## Motivation
A logograph is a written character that represents a word or morpheme, whereas a
unicode is an information technology standard for the consistent encoding,
representation, and handling of texts. A vanilla NFT by [EIP-3754](./eip-3754.md)
with `tokenId` being specified as a certain unicode can be used to represent a
logograpic character on-chain. This standard aims to combine the two and introduce
necessary the functionalities for batch transfer and representation of vanilla
NFTs. As a result a new language system can be opened up for on-chain
representation of logograpic languages.

This is particularly valuable for logographs because a rich amount of meanings
can be transmitted in just a few characters. For non-logographic languages, although
the same unicode standard can be applied, it is not providing significant additional
utility to be practically useful. Emojis are similar with logographs and can be
included as well.

A motivating example is instead of sending the two Chinese characters of the
Great Wall `长城`, two EIP-3754 tokens with ID`#38271` and ID`#22478` that are the
corresponding decimal unicodes can be sent. The receiving end decodes the IDs
and retrieves the original characters. A key point is the ordering information
matters in this scenario since the tuples `(#38271, #22478)` and
`(#22478, #38271)` mean `长城` and `城长`, respectively, and both are legitimate
words in the Chinese language.

Besides, in the eastern Asian culture, characters are sometimes considered or
practically used as gifts in holidays such as Spring Feastival, etc.
`(#24685, #21916, #21457, #36001)` `恭喜发财` can be used literally as a gift to
express the best wishes for financial prosperity. That said, logographs do possess
the nature of an asset, which is well resembled by this standard.

What is even more interesting is in that culture, people consider ancient teachings
as treasures which are usually written in an obscure way such that a handle of
characters can unfold a rich amount of meanings. Modern people now get a chance to
speak to the future generations by sending tokens.

## Specification
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
    @title EIP-4341 Unicoded NFT Standard

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] calldata _ids, uint256[] calldata _values, bytes calldata _data) external;

    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) external view returns (uint256);

    function balanceOfBatch(address[] calldata _owners, uint256[] calldata _ids) external view returns (uint256[] memory);

    function retrievePhrase(address _owner, uint256 _phraseId) external view returns (uint256[] memory);

    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
}
```

## Rationale
If we think of [ERC1155](./eip-1155.md) together with [ERC721](./eip-721.md) being
in the track of representing crypto-assets with tokens, then [EIP-3754](./eip-3754.md)
and this standard EIP-4341 can be best understood as representing the utility
sides of NFTs.

### Ordering information
Compared with ERC1155, this standard is particularly useful in logographic
representations. Therefore, the ordering information in a batch of tokenIds is
maintained whereas such information is completed discarded in ERC1155. It is not
a problem in ERC1155 since no valuable information is encoded in the order of
tokenIds, however, in this standard, as illustrated above, it is crucial in
decoding the unicodes of a sequence of logographs in the correct order.

### `URI`
To further distinguish this standard from ERC1155, `URI`s should be excluded in
implementation of this standard. No external information is required to be encoded
with the tokens. TokenIds are the sole source of information to transfer ideas,
thoughts and even emotions.

### Phrase and sentence
In a language system, chracters in a batch form a phrase or even a sentence. To
retrieve it effectively, a `phraseId` is introduced. The phrases or sentences are
not meant to be disseminated at any time. They should be kept in storage as a
form of assets that can be retrieved and interpreted, but not transferred. The
tokens themselves, however, are able to be transferred.

## Backwards Compatibility
[EIP-3754](./eip-3754.md) is a pre-requisite to this standard.
