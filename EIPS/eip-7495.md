## Abstract

This EIP introduces a new [Simple Serialize (SSZ)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md) type to represent containers with forward-compatible Merkleization: A given field is always assigned the same stable [generalized index (gindex)](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/merkle-proofs.md#generalized-merkle-tree-index) even when different container versions append new fields or drop existing fields.

## Motivation

SSZ containers are frequently versioned, for example across fork boundaries. When the number of fields reaches a new power of two, or a field is removed or replaced with one of a different type, the shape of the underlying Merkle tree changes, breaking verifiers of Merkle proofs for these containers. Deploying a new verifier may involve security councils to upgrade smart contract logic, or require firmware updates for embedded devices. This effort is needed even when no semantic changes apply to the fields that the verifier is interested in.

Progressive containers address these shortcomings by:

- Using the [progressive Merkle tree](./eip-7916.md) structure to progressively grow to the actual field count with minimal overhead, ensuring provers remain valid as the field count changes.
- Assigning stable gindices for each field across all versions by allowing gaps in the Merkle tree where a field is absent.
- Serializing in a compact form where absent fields do not consume space.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### `ProgressiveContainer(active_fields)`

A new [SSZ composite types](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#composite-types) is defined:

- **progressive container**: ordered heterogeneous collection of values with stable Merkleization
  - python dataclass notation with key-type pairs, e.g.

  ```python
  class Square(ProgressiveContainer(active_fields=[1, 0, 1])):
      side: uint16  # Merkleized at field index #0 (location of first 1 in `active_fields`)
      color: uint8  # Merkleized at field index #2 (location of second 1 in `active_fields`)

  class Circle(ProgressiveContainer(active_fields=[0, 1, 1])):
      radius: uint16  # Merkleized at field index #1 (location of first 1 in `active_fields`)
      color: uint8  # Merkleized at field index #2 (location of second 1 in `active_fields`)
  ```

The [default value](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#default-values) is defined as:

| Type                                   | Default Value                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `ProgressiveContainer(active_fields)`  | `[default(type) for type in progressive_container]` |

The following types are considered [illegal](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#illegal-types):

- `ProgressiveContainer` with no fields are illegal.
- `ProgressiveContainer` with an `active_fields` configuration of more than 256 entries are illegal.
- `ProgressiveContainer` with an `active_fields` configuration ending in `0` are illegal.
- `ProgressiveContainer` with an `active_fields` configuration with a different count of `1` than fields are illegal.

#### Serialization

Serialization of `ProgressiveContainer(active_fields)` is identical to [`Container`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#vectors-containers-lists).

#### Deserialization

Deserialization of `ProgressiveContainer(active_fields)` is identical to [`Container`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#deserialization).

#### JSON mapping

The canonical [JSON mapping](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#json-mapping) is updated:

| SSZ                                   | JSON   | Example            |
| ------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| `ProgressiveContainer(active_fields)` | object | `{ "field": ... }` |

#### Merkleization

The [SSZ Merkleization specification](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/ad36024441cf910d428d03f87f331fbbd2b3e5f1/ssz/simple-serialize.md#merkleization) is extended with two helper functions:

- `get_active_fields(value)`, where `value` is of type `ProgressiveContainer(active_fields)`: return `active_fields`.
- `mix_in_active_fields`: Given a Merkle root `root` and an `active_fields` configuration return `hash(root, pack_bits(active_fields))`. Note that `active_fields` is restricted to ≤ 256 bits.

The Merkleization definitions are extended.

- `mix_in_active_fields(merkleize_progressive([hash_tree_root(element) for element in value]), get_active_fields(value))` if `value` is a progressive container.

## Rationale

### Why is `active_fields` limited to 256 bits?

256 bits (1 word) allows the mix-in to be simple, consistent with the length mix-in for lists, and is practically sufficient. An alternate design with a `ProgressiveBitlist` mix-in was explored, however deemed too over-engineered as it would effectively require introducing caches to pre-compute the mix-in's `hash_tree_root` to avoid repeated computations, and also makes verifier logic more complex than necessary.

Even though the 256 field limit includes all fields (including deprecated ones), it is unlikely that many progressive containers come close to reach 256 fields (`BeaconState` currently reaches around 40 fields). If that happens, one can add a `more` field with a nested `ProgressiveContainer`.

### Why is empty `ProgressiveContainer` an illegal type?

It would result in 0-length serialization, meaning that the length of a list of such a container cannot be determined from the serialization.

### `Optional[type]`?

Introducing `Optional` is not required by any current functionality and is deferred to a future EIP.

The `active_fields` bitvector can be updated to also indicate optionality. Further, serialization for sparse lists should be explored.

## Backwards Compatibility

`ProgressiveContainer(active_fields)` is a new SSZ type and does not conflict with existing types.

## Test Cases

- `ethereum/remerkleable` contains static tests in `test_impl.py` and `test_typing.py`.
- `ethereum/consensus-specs` releases contain random tests in `tests/general/phase0/ssz_generic`, generated according to a format defined in `tests/format/ssz_generic`.

## Reference Implementation

See `ethereum/remerkleable`.

## Security Considerations

Light client based verifiers and smart contracts (e.g., based on [EIP-4788](./eip-4788.md)) do not update at the same cadence as Ethereum. If a future fork removes a field from a `ProgressiveContainer(active_fields)`, the `active_fields` mix-in enables such verifiers to distinguish absent fields from `0` values. Without `active_fields`, the `hash_tree_root` for these cases would collide.
