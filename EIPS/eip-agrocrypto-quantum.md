\# Abstract



This EIP defines a compliance-grade, AI-native protocol for ESG-compliant asset tokenization, governed by ATF-AI and protected by post-quantum cryptography.  

It codifies lifecycle, metadata, and auditability for compliance-grade deployment, aligns with UN SDGs, and enforces machine-verifiable governance for public, audit-ready markets.



\# Specification



\## Metadata Structure



Tokens MUST expose a metadata JSON with the following minimum fields:



```json

{

&nbsp; "standard": "ERC-ESG/1.0",

&nbsp; "category": "carbon",

&nbsp; "geo": "BR-RS",

&nbsp; "carbon\_value": 12.5,

&nbsp; "cycle": "2025-Q3",

&nbsp; "digest": "sha3-512:...",

&nbsp; "physical\_id": "seal:XYZ123",

&nbsp; "attestation": {

&nbsp;   "atf\_digest": "sha3-512:...",

&nbsp;   "signer": "did:atf:ai:..."

&nbsp; },

&nbsp; "status": "issued|audited|retired",

&nbsp; "evidence": "cid:Qm..."

}

```



\### Interface



Contracts SHOULD implement (Solidity):



```solidity

function mintESGToken(Metadata memory metadata) external;

function auditESGToken(uint256 tokenId) external;

function retireESGToken(uint256 tokenId) external;

function esgURI(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (string memory);

```



\### Events



```solidity

event Attested(uint256 indexed tokenId, bytes32 atfDigest, string esgURI);

event Retired(uint256 indexed tokenId, uint256 amount, string reason);

```



\### JSON-RPC Example



```json

eth\_call \[

&nbsp; "0xContractAddress",

&nbsp; "mintESGToken",

&nbsp; {

&nbsp;   "metadata": {

&nbsp;     "category": "carbon",

&nbsp;     "geo": "BR-RS",

&nbsp;     "digest": "sha3-512:..."

&nbsp;   }

&nbsp; }

]

```



\### Mapping \& Compatibility



\- \*\*ERC-20:\*\* Each unit = a standardized fraction (e.g., 1e18 = 1 tCO2e).

\- \*\*ERC-721:\*\* Single credit, unique esgURI.

\- \*\*ERC-1155:\*\* Homogeneous batch with common URI and amount.



\# Rationale



This protocol is designed for compliance-grade and non-speculative deployment.  

It enforces deterministic flows, immutable metadata, machine-verifiable audit trails, and compliance-grade governance.  

`atfDigest` and `buildDigest` unite off-chain audit with on-chain proof.  

The protocol is extensible and avoids hard-forks by using optional interfaces and events.



Within this framework, \*\*AI-Compliance\*\* is defined as:  

\*\*AI-Compliance = AI-Governed DAO\*\*



This establishes ATF-AI as a compliance mechanism where governance is executed through an AI-Governed DAO, rather than discretionary human oversight.  

It codifies compliance into a machine-verifiable, audit-ready process that remains deterministic across jurisdictions.



\# Backwards Compatibility



Does not break ERC-20/721/1155.  

Legacy tokens may reference metadata externally but lack full ATF-AI compliance.  

Migration tools can wrap legacy tokens with compliant metadata, enabling gradual adoption.



\# Test Cases



\- Mint token with valid metadata.

\- Audit token with ATF-AI digest.

\- Retire token and log final audit state.

\- Validate physical seal against metadata digest.



\# Security Considerations



\- Metadata MUST be immutable and cryptographically sealed.

\- ATF-AI provides zero-trust validation; all attestations timestamped.

\- Digest (SHA3-512) ensures audit integrity.

\- Quantum-ready primitives recommended for all bridges.

\- Retirement is irreversible; physical seals MUST validate against digest.

\- All inputs and off-chain docs must be hashed and publicly referenced.



\# Reference Implementation



\- Crate: agrocrypto-core v2.0.0

\- GitHub: agrocrypto-core

\- ESG Manifest: ESG-Manifest

\- AgroCryptoGit Profile: AgroCryptoGit

\- Manifesto: Human+AI (published with hash)
