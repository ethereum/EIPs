This proposal describes the introduction in clients of a controlled gas limit increase strategy to determine the gas limit of a specific block and set as default with conservative parameters, while keeping the possibility to change it in the future to a fixed value.

## **Abstract**

The EIP proposes the introduction of a new gas limit management mechanism that automatically increases the block gas limit over a two-year period. The incremental growth is controlled by a fixed rate, ensuring predictable network scaling while preventing sudden surges in block sizes. 

## **Motivation**

### **Predictable Gas Limit Growth**

- **Current Issue:**
  - The Ethereum network faces increasing demand, but changes to the gas limit are often manually adjusted by miners or validators based on their preferences, which may cause unpredictable block sizes and network performance issues.

- **Need for Change:**
  - A systematic and predictable increase of the gas limit will help scale the network while giving the ecosystem time to adjust to larger block sizes, without needing to rely on ad hoc decisions by network participants.

### **Gradual Increase with Deactivation Safeguard**

- **Controlled Growth:**
  - Instead of sudden or unpredictable changes, this EIP proposes incremental gas limit increases over a specified amount of time, ensuring a smooth transition to higher transaction throughput, while still keeping the governance of the gas limit in the hand of the community.
  
- **Automatic Deactivation:**
  - A safeguard deactivation block will halt the increase after some specified time, preventing the gas limit from growing indefinitely and allowing the community to reassess the network's needs.

## **Specification**

### **Incremental Gas Limit Increase Strategy**

Add a new "Gas Limit" selection strategy that takes in Block Number `N` and spits out the Gas Limit `GL` for that block. The strategy is as follows:

 - The gas limit `GL_t` at block `t` is calculated as:
```GL_t = GL_0 * (1 + r)^t```
   Where:
   - `GL_0` is the initial gas limit (say 30 million gas).
   - `r` is the per-block increase rate (0.00475% or 0.0000475).
   - `t` is the number of blocks since the implementation of the EIP.
   - The increase halts once `t` reaches the block corresponding to two years (approximately 5,184,000 blocks, assuming 12-second block times). this parameters are tuned so that there is a doubling of the gas limit in two years.

### **Implementation**

- **Client Updates:**
  - Ethereum clients must implement the automatic gas limit increase according to the specified rate and formula, with enforcement of the deactivation block.
  
- **Gas Limit Management:**
  - Miners and validators are not required to adjust the gas limit manually during this period, as the increase will be automated at the protocol level.

## **Rationale**

### **Predictable Growth**

- **Systematic Adjustment:**
  - The gradual increase avoids sudden surges in gas limit that could destabilize the network. Instead, it provides a smooth transition, giving the ecosystem time to adapt to larger block sizes.

### **Controlled Limit with Deactivation Block**

- **Automatic Safeguard:**
  - The inclusion of a deactivation block ensures that the gas limit does not increase indefinitely, preventing potential negative impacts on network performance beyond the planned growth.


- **Community Consensus:**
  - The deactivation block serves only as a checkpoint for the community to evaluate the impact of the gas limit increase, however, in the two-year period, the community can decide to halt the increase at any time and can also switch to a fixed gas limit if needed.
