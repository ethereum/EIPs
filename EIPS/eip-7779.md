This proposal introduces a mechanism to gradually increase the block gas limit over two years, doubling from 30 million to 60 million gas, with an automatic deactivation at a specified block height. The purpose is to provide a controlled and predictable growth of block capacity to meet increasing network demand while ensuring network stability.

## **Abstract**

The EIP proposes a system to increase the block gas limit by a fixed amount at regular intervals over a two-year period. The block gas limit will increase incrementally from 30 million gas to 60 million gas, with a safeguard "deactivation block" that halts the increase after two years. This system is designed to accommodate network growth without imposing abrupt changes, giving developers, node operators, and users time to adapt. The incremental increase is fully automated, ensuring transparent and predictable block size growth.

## **Motivation**

### **Predictable Gas Limit Growth**

- **Current Issue:**
  - The Ethereum network faces increasing demand, but changes to the gas limit are often manually adjusted by miners or validators based on their preferences, which may cause unpredictable block sizes and network performance issues.

- **Need for Change:**
  - A systematic and predictable increase of the gas limit will help scale the network while giving the ecosystem time to adjust to larger block sizes, without needing to rely on ad hoc decisions by network participants.

### **Gradual Increase with Deactivation Safeguard**

- **Controlled Growth:**
  - Instead of sudden or unpredictable changes, this EIP proposes incremental gas limit increases over two years, which will gradually double the block capacity.
  
- **Automatic Deactivation:**
  - A safeguard deactivation block will halt the increase after two years, ensuring that the gas limit does not grow indefinitely without further consensus from the community.

## **Specification**

### **Incremental Gas Limit Increase**

1. **Initial Block Gas Limit:**
   - At the start of the proposal, the block gas limit is set to 30 million gas.

2. **Increase Rate:**
   - The block gas limit will increase by 0.00475% per block (approximately 1.5% per day), such that after approximately 730 days (two years), the gas limit reaches 60 million.

3. **Deactivation Block:**
   - The gas limit increase will automatically halt at a specific block height, calculated as the block occurring roughly two years after the proposal's implementation. This "deactivation block" ensures no further increases occur after this period.

4. **Formula for Gas Limit Increase:**
   - The gas limit `GL_t` at block `t` is calculated as:
   ```python
   GL_t = GL_0 * (1 + r)^t
   ```
   Where:
   - `GL_0` is the initial gas limit (30 million gas).
   - `r` is the per-block increase rate (0.00475% or 0.0000475).
   - `t` is the number of blocks since the implementation of the EIP.
   - The increase halts once `t` reaches the block corresponding to two years (approximately 5,184,000 blocks, assuming 12-second block times).

5. **Post-Deactivation Block Limit:**
   - After the deactivation block, the gas limit remains fixed at 60 million gas unless further action is taken by the community.

### **Implementation**

- **Client Updates:**
  - Ethereum clients must implement the automatic gas limit increase according to the specified rate and formula, with enforcement of the deactivation block.
  
- **Gas Limit Management:**
  - Miners and validators are not required to adjust the gas limit manually during this period, as the increase will be automated at the protocol level.

## **Rationale**

### **Predictable Growth**

- **Systematic Adjustment:**
  - The gradual increase avoids sudden surges in gas limit that could destabilize the network. Instead, it provides a smooth transition, giving the ecosystem time to adapt to larger block sizes.

### **Controlled Limit with Deactivation Block**

- **Automatic Safeguard:**
  - The inclusion of a deactivation block ensures that the gas limit does not increase indefinitely, preventing potential negative impacts on network performance beyond the planned growth.

- **Post-Deactivation Flexibility:**
  - After the two-year period, the community can reassess the network's needs and decide on further gas limit adjustments if required.

- **Community Consensus:**
  - The deactivation block serves only as a checkpoint for the community to evaluate the impact of the gas limit increase, however, in the two-year period, the community can decide to halt the increase at any time within any hard fork.

## **Backwards Compatibility**

- **Hard Fork Required:**
  - The changes to the gas limit management will require a hard fork. Node operators must update their clients to support the new automated gas limit increase mechanism.



## **Security Considerations**

- **Network Congestion:**
  - The gradual increase in block size may result in higher transaction throughput, but the rate of increase is controlled to minimize the risk of overwhelming the network.
