## Abstract

<!--
  The Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

This EIP defines an interface to carry a real world asset with some privileges that can be exercised by the holder of the corresponding NFT. The EIP standardizes the interface for non-fungible tokens representing real world assets with privileges to be exercised, such as products sold onchain which can be redeemed in the real world.

## Motivation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems the EIP solves. It should not describe how the EIP solves those problems, unless it is not immediately obvious. It should not describe why the EIP should be made into a standard, unless it is not immediately obvious.

  With a few exceptions, external links are not allowed. If you feel that a particular resource would demonstrate a compelling case for your EIP, then save it as a printer-friendly PDF, put it in the assets folder, and link to that copy.

NFTs bound to real-world assets sometimes need to carry certain privileges that can be exercised by the holder. Users can initiate transactions onchain to specify the exercise of a certain privilege, thereby achieving real-world privileges that directly map the onchain privilege through subsequent operations. For example, if a certain product such as a pair of shoes is sold onchain in the representation of NFT, the NFT holder can exercise the privilege of exchanging physical shoes offchain, to achieve the purpose of interoperability between the blockchain and the real world.

Having a standard interface enables interoperability for services, clients, UI, and inter-contract functionalities on top of this use-case.


## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (besu, erigon, ethereumjs, go-ethereum, nethermind, or others).

  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

This EIP inherits the ERC-721 NFT token standard for all transfer and approval logic. All transfer and approval functions are inherited from this token standard without changes. Additionally, this EIP also inherits the ERC-721 Metadata standards for name, symbol, and metadata URI lookup. 

Any compliant contract following this EIP **MUST** implement the following interface:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

/// @title ERC-7766 Privileged Non-Fungible Tokens Tied To Real World Assets
/// @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7766
interface IERC7766 /* is IERC721, IERC165 */ {

    /// @notice This event emitted when a specific privilege of a token is successfully exercised.
    /// @param _operator  the address who exercised the privilege.
    /// @param _to  the address to benefit from the privilege.
    /// @param _tokenId  the NFT tokenID.
    /// @param _privilegeId  the ID of the privileges.
    event PrivilegeExercised(
        address indexed _operator,
        address indexed _to,
        uint256 indexed _tokenId,
        uint256 _privilegeId
    );

    /// @notice This function exercise a specific privilege of a token.
    /// @dev Throws if `_privilegeId` is not a valid privilegeId.
    /// @param _to  the address to benefit from the privilege.
    /// @param _tokenId  the NFT tokenID.
    /// @param _privilegeId  the ID of the privileges.
    /// @param _data  extra data passed in for extra message or future extension.
    function exercisePrivilege(
        address _to,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _privilegeId,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external;

    /// @notice This function is to check whether a specific privilege of a token can be exercised.
    /// @dev Throws if `_privilegeId` is not a valid privilegeId.
    /// @param _to  the address to benefit from the privilege.
    /// @param _tokenId  the NFT tokenID.
    /// @param _privilegeId  the ID of the privileges.
    function isExercisable(
        address _to,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _privilegeId
    ) external view returns (bool _exercisable);

    /// @notice This function is to check whether a specific privilege of a token has been exercised.
    /// @dev Throws if `_privilegeId` is not a valid privilegeId.
    /// @param _to  the address to benefit from the privilege.
    /// @param _tokenId  the NFT tokenID.
    /// @param _privilegeId  the ID of the privileges.
    function isExercised(
        address _to,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _privilegeId
    ) external view returns (bool _exercised);

    /// @notice This function is to list all privilegeIds of a token.
    /// @param _tokenId  the NFT tokenID.
    function getPrivilegeIds(
        uint256 _tokenId
    ) external view returns (uint256[] memory privilegeIds);

}
```

The **metadata extension** is OPTIONAL for ERC-7766 smart contracts. This allows your smart contract to be interrogated for its details about the privileges which your NFTs carry.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

/// @title ERC-7766 Privileged Non-Fungible Tokens Tied To Real World Assets, optional metadata extension
/// @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7766
interface IERC7766Metadata /* is IERC7766 */ {

    /// @notice A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given privilegeId.
    /// @dev Throws if `_privilegeId` is not a valid privilegeId. URIs are defined in RFC
    ///  3986. The URI may point to a JSON file that conforms to the "ERC-7766
    ///  Metadata JSON Schema".
    function privilegeURI(uint256 _privilegeId) external view returns (string memory);

}
```

This is the “ERC-7766 Metadata JSON Schema” referenced above.
```
{
    "title": "Privilege Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Identifies the specific privilege."
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describes the specific privilege."
        },
        "resource": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource representing the specific privilege."
        }
    }
}
```

## Rationale

<!--
  The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting

1. The function `exercisePrivilege` performs the exercise action to a specific privilege of a token. If succeeds, it is expected to emit a PrivilegeExercised event. With this event emitted onchain, we can determine that the user has confirmed the exercise of this privilege, so as to implement the privilege in the real world.

2. We choose to include an address `_to` for functions `exercisePrivilege`, `isExercisable` and `isExercised` so that a specific privilege of an NFT MAY be exercised for someone who will benefit from it other than the NFT holder nor the transaction initiator. And This EIP doesn't assume who has the power to perform this action, it's totally decided by the developers who are using this standard.

3. We choose to include an extra `_data` field to function `exercisePrivilege` for extra message or future extension. For example, developers can use `_data` to exercise a privilege that takes effect directly onchain such as direct distribution of cryptocurrency assets.

4. The boolean view functions of `isExercisable` and `isExercised` can be used to check whether a specific privilege of an NFT can be exercisable or has been exercised to the `_to` address.

5. The function `getPrivilegeIds` provides a way to manage the binding relationship between NFTs and privilegeIds.

6. IERC7766Metadata provides specifications for obtaining metadata information of privileges. A contract that implements IERC7766Metadata **SHALL** also implement IERC7766.

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--

  This section is optional.

  All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

This standard is an extension of EIP-721. It is fully compatible with both of the commonly used optional extensions (IERC721Metadata and IERC721Enumerable) mentioned in the EIP-721 standard.

## Reference Implementation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The Reference Implementation section should include a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should not include project build files. The reference implementation is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.
  If the reference implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting

The reference implementation of Privileged NFTs can be found [here](https://github.com/Mint-Blockchain/ERC7766-example/blob/main/src/example/ERC7766Example.sol).

## Security Considerations

<!--
  All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

Compliant contracts should pay attention to the storage to the states of the privileges. The contract should properly handle the state transition of each privilege of each NFT, clearly showing that each privilege is exercisable or has been exercised.

Compliant contracts should also carefully define access control, particularly whether any EOA or contract account may or may not call `exercisePrivilege` function in any use case. Security audits and tests should be used to verify that the access control to the `exercisePrivilege` function behaves as expected.
