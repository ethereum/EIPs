## Abstract

This standard is an extension of [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md). It proposes an additional role (`user`) which can be granted to addresses that represent a `user` of the assets rather than an `owner`.

## Motivation

Like [EIP-721](./eip-721.md), [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md) tokens may have utility of some kind. The people who “use” the token may be different than the people who own it (such as in a rental). Thus, it would be useful to have separate roles for the “owner” and the “user” so that the “user” would not be able to take actions that the owner could (for example, transferring ownership).

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

    /**

     * - `amount` The new user could use
     */ 
    function setUser(address owner, address user, uint256 id, uint256 amount) external;
}

```

The `supportsInterface` method MUST return `true` when called with `0x208994f8`.

## Rationale

This model is intended to facilitate easy implementation. The following are some problems that are solved by this standard:

### Clear Rights Assignment

With Dual “owner” and “user” roles, it becomes significantly easier to manage what lenders and borrowers can and cannot do with the NFT (in other words, their rights).  For example, for the right to transfer ownership, the project simply needs to check whether the address taking the action represents the owner or the user and prevent the transaction if it is the user.  Additionally, owners can control who the user is and it is easy for other projects to assign their own rights to either the owners or the users.

### Easy Third-Party Integration

In the spirit of permissionless interoperability, this standard makes it easier for third-party protocols to manage NFT usage rights without permission from the NFT issuer or the NFT application. Once a project has adopted the additional `user` role, any other project can directly interact with these features and implement their own type of transaction. For example, a PFP NFT using this standard can be integrated into both a rental platform where users can rent the NFT for 30 days AND, at the same time, a mortgage platform where users can use the NFT while eventually buying ownership of the NFT with installment payments. This would all be done without needing the permission of the original PFP project.

## Backwards Compatibility

As mentioned in the specifications section, this standard can be fully ERC compatible by adding an extension function set, and there are no conflicts between EIP-5006 and EIP-1155.

In addition, new functions introduced in this standard have many similarities with the existing functions in EIP-1155. This allows developers to easily adopt the standard quickly.

## Test Cases

Test cases are included in [test.js](../assets/eip-5006/test/test.ts). 

Run in terminal: 
1. ```cd ../assets/eip-5006```
1. ```npm install```
1. ```npx hardhat test ./test/test.ts```

## Reference Implementation

See [ERC5006.sol](../assets/eip-5006/contracts/ERC5006.sol).

## Security Considerations

This EIP standard can completely protect the rights of the owner, the owner can change the NFT user, the user can not transfer the NFT.
