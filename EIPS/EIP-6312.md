EIP:	6312
Title:	Hierarchical NFTs with Splitting and Merging
Author(s):	Nitin Bhagat (bhagatnitin312@gmail.com)
Status:	Draft
Type:	Standard
Category:	ERC
Created:	2025-2-15
Requires:	ERC-721, ERC-6150

Abstract
This standard extends EIP-721 and EIP-6150. This introduces a structured parent-child relationship between NFTs, allowing an NFT to be fractionally split into multiple child NFTs and merged back into a single entity. It provides interfaces to retrieve an NFT’s parent, children, and hierarchical status, ensuring flexible ownership management. This standard is particularly useful for applications in fractional ownership, asset distribution, and composable digital assets, opening new possibilities in fields like real estate, gaming, and decentralized finance.

Motivation
ERC-6312 introduces hierarchical NFTs with splitting and merging capabilities, allowing assets to be dynamically restructured. This proposal is crucial for fractional ownership, gaming assets, and financial instruments, where assets need to be split or merged. 
1. Splitting: One of the key limitations of ERC-6150 is its rigid hierarchy, where NFTs are permanently assigned to a parent without the ability to restructure ownership. In many real-world scenarios, assets need to be split into smaller, independent units. ERC-6312 introduces a standardized way to split an NFT into multiple child NFTs, enabling dynamic asset management. For example, in financial markets, a share NFT can be split into multiple fractional share NFTs, allowing investors to own and trade smaller portions of a share.

2. Merging: Just as assets need to be split, there are scenarios where multiple NFTs should be combined into a single entity. ERC-6312 enables a merging mechanism, allowing child NFTs to be consolidated into a single parent NFT, allowing asset management and transactions. For instance, in finance, fractional share NFTs can be merged back into a full share NFT, enabling seamless ownership consolidation. This is particularly useful for investors who gradually accumulate fractions of a stock and later want to own a full share.

3. Share Distribution: ERC-6312 introduces ownership share management, allowing NFTs to track and distribute fractional ownership among multiple stakeholders. This solves fractional ownership tracking within parent-child NFT structures. This also allows dynamic adjustments of ownership based on splitting and merging actions. For example, a real estate NFT representing a building can have multiple owners with different share percentages. When the NFT is split, the new NFTs retain a proportion of the original ownership share. When merged, the system redistributes the shares accordingly. This Enables multi-party ownership in digital assets.
