## Abstract

This EIP defines an extension to [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) that records the **complete ownership history** of every non-fungible token on-chain. ERC-721 tracks only the current owner; the moment a token is transferred, on-chain evidence that the previous holder ever possessed it is lost. This standard introduces a **three-layer ownership model**:

| Layer | Name | Mutability | Purpose |
|:------|:-----|:-----------|:--------|
| 1 | Immutable Origin | Write-once | Records who minted / created the token |
| 2 | Historical Trail | Append-only | Chronological list of every past owner |
| 3 | Current Authority | Mutable | Standard ERC-721 `ownerOf()` semantics |

A compliant contract MUST implement [ERC-721](./eip-721.md), [ERC-165](./eip-165.md), and the `IERC721H` interface defined herein.

## Motivation

### The Problem

ERC-721 stores exactly one piece of ownership data: the **current** owner. When Alice transfers Token #1 to Bob, and Bob transfers to Charlie, there is no storage-level ownership record accessible to other smart contracts proving Alice ever held the token. The only evidence lives in `Transfer` event logs, which:

1. **Cannot be read by other smart contracts** — `eth_getLogs` is an off-chain JSON-RPC call, not an EVM opcode.
2. **Require off-chain indexers** — The Graph, Alchemy, or custom infrastructure must be trusted to reconstruct history.
3. **Are fragile** — Indexers go down, have lag, and cost money. Archive nodes are expensive.
4. **Cannot power on-chain governance** — A DAO cannot grant "founding member" privileges based on event logs alone.

This proposal does not aim to replace event logs, but to enable **on-chain composable history** — ownership data that other smart contracts can read and act on natively, without off-chain intermediaries.

### Real-World Use Cases That ERC-721 Cannot Serve

1. **Art Provenance**: A collector wants on-chain proof that a Picasso NFT passed through Christie's gallery. ERC-721 cannot answer "did address X ever own token Y?" without an indexer.

2. **Founder Benefits**: A project wants to give perpetual 2% royalties to the original minter of each token, even after they sell. ERC-721 discards the minter address on first transfer.

3. **Early Adopter Airdrops**: A protocol wants to airdrop governance tokens to everyone who held an NFT during the first 100 blocks. With ERC-721, this requires reconstructing history from logs off-chain and submitting a Merkle root — expensive, slow, and trust-dependent.

4. **Proof-of-Custody**: In a dispute over rightful ownership, on-chain storage provides a directly queryable chain of custody. Event logs require off-chain reconstruction and indexer infrastructure; storage slots are natively readable by any smart contract.

5. **Gaming Veteran Status**: A game wants to show a "Day 1 Player" badge to anyone who minted during launch week, regardless of whether they still hold the token.

### Why Extend ERC-721 Instead of Creating a New Standard?

This standard is a **strict superset** of ERC-721. Every token implementing this standard is a valid ERC-721 token. Wallets, marketplaces, and existing tooling interact with it identically. The historical layer is additive — contracts that don't need history simply ignore it.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Interface

This standard defines two interfaces:

- **`IERC721H`** (Core) — MUST be implemented. Origin tracking, historical ownership, O(log n) block resolution, and pagination.
- **`IERC721HAnalytics`** (Optional) — MAY be implemented. Convenience queries: provenance reports, early adopter detection, per-address enumeration, and supply tracking.

#### Analytics Extension (`IERC721HAnalytics`)

Implementations MAY additionally implement the following convenience interface. Support is signaled via [ERC-165](./eip-165.md).

        external view returns (uint256[] memory tokenIds);

    /// @notice DEPRECATED: Use getOwnerAtBlock() from IERC721H instead.
    function getOwnerAtTimestamp(uint256 tokenId, uint256 timestamp) external pure returns (address);
}
```

### Behavioral Requirements

#### Layer 1 — Immutable Origin

1. `originalCreator(tokenId)` MUST be set exactly once, at mint time.
2. `originalCreator(tokenId)` MUST NOT change after mint, even if the token is transferred or burned.
3. `mintBlock(tokenId)` MUST record `block.number` at the time of minting.
4. The contract MUST emit `OriginalCreatorRecorded(tokenId, creator)` exactly once per token, at mint.

#### Layer 2 — Historical Trail

5. On every transfer (including mint), the recipient address MUST be appended to the ownership history for `tokenId`.
6. The ownership history MUST be append-only. Entries MUST NOT be removed, modified, or reordered.
7. `hasEverOwned(tokenId, account)` MUST execute in O(1) time. Implementations SHOULD use a nested `mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool))`.
8. `getOwnershipHistory(tokenId)` MUST return two parallel arrays of equal length: addresses and timestamps, in chronological order. The first element MUST be the original creator.
9. The `_everOwnedTokens` mapping MUST be deduplicated — if an address receives the same token twice (e.g., Alice → Bob → Alice), the token ID MUST appear only once in Alice's list.
10. The contract MUST emit `OwnershipHistoryRecorded(tokenId, newOwner, timestamp)` on every mint and transfer.

All pagination functions (both core and analytics) MUST return an empty array if `start >= length`. They MUST NOT revert.

#### Layer 3 — Current Authority

11. Layer 3 MUST behave identically to ERC-721. `ownerOf()`, `balanceOf()`, `transferFrom()`, `safeTransferFrom()`, `approve()`, `setApprovalForAll()`, `getApproved()`, and `isApprovedForAll()` MUST comply with ERC-721.

#### Sybil Protection (Dual-Layer)

17. Contracts SHOULD implement intra-transaction protection to block multiple transfers of the same token within one transaction (A→B→C chains). If transient storage ([EIP-1153](./eip-1153.md)) is available on the target chain, implementations SHOULD use it for this purpose.
18. Contracts SHOULD implement inter-transaction protection to enforce one owner per token per block number across separate transactions. The reference implementation derives this from `_ownershipBlocks[tokenId]` — if the last recorded block equals `block.number`, the transfer reverts. No dedicated `_ownerAtBlock` mapping is needed. When implemented, `block.number` MUST be used instead of `block.timestamp` to prevent validator manipulation.
19. `getOwnerAtBlock(tokenId, blockNumber)` MUST return the owner of `tokenId` at any arbitrary `blockNumber`, not just blocks where a transfer occurred. Implementations SHOULD use O(log n) binary search over the chronological `_ownershipBlocks` array to resolve the last transfer at or before `blockNumber`. Returns `address(0)` if the token was not yet minted at `blockNumber`.
21. Contracts MUST prevent self-transfers (`from == to`) to avoid polluting Layer 2 history without actual ownership change.

#### Burn Behavior

12. When a token is burned, Layer 3 data (current owner) MUST be cleared.
13. When a token is burned, implementations SHOULD preserve Layer 1 data (`originalCreator`, `mintBlock`). Implementations that do not preserve MUST document this behavior.
14. When a token is burned, implementations SHOULD preserve Layer 2 data (`_ownershipHistory`, `_ownershipTimestamps`, `_hasOwnedToken`). Implementations that do not preserve MUST document this behavior.
15. When Layer 1 and Layer 2 data are preserved after burn, `originalCreator(tokenId)` MUST still return the original minter and `getOwnershipHistory(tokenId)` MUST return the full history. Implementations SHOULD use `originalCreator[tokenId]` (not `_currentOwner[tokenId]`) for existence checks in view functions so that Layer 2 queries survive burn.

#### ERC-165

16. Compliant contracts MUST implement [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) and return `true` for:
    - `0x01ffc9a7` ([ERC-165](./eip-165.md))
    - `0x80ac58cd` ([ERC-721](./eip-721.md))
    - The interface ID computed as the XOR of all function selectors in `IERC721H`
    - If `IERC721HAnalytics` is implemented, additionally the interface ID of `IERC721HAnalytics`

#### Analytics Extension (`IERC721HAnalytics`) — OPTIONAL

The following requirements apply only to contracts that implement the optional `IERC721HAnalytics` interface:

A1. `isEarlyAdopter(account, blockThreshold)` MUST execute in O(n) time where n is the number of tokens created by `account`. Implementations MUST NOT iterate over global token supply.
A2. `getEverOwnedTokensLength(account)` MUST return the length of the deduplicated per-address token list.
A3. `getEverOwnedTokensSlice(account, start, count)` MUST return a slice of at most `count` token IDs starting at index `start`.
A4. `getCreatedTokensLength(creator)` MUST return the length of the per-creator token list.
A5. `getCreatedTokensSlice(creator, start, count)` MUST return a slice of at most `count` token IDs starting at index `start`.
A6. `getOwnerAtTimestamp()` is DEPRECATED. It MUST be `pure` and MUST always return `address(0)`.
A7. All per-address pagination functions MUST return an empty array if `start >= length`. They MUST NOT revert.

### Events

| Event | When Emitted |
|:------|:-------------|
| `OwnershipHistoryRecorded(uint256 tokenId, address newOwner, uint256 timestamp)` | Every mint and transfer |
| `OriginalCreatorRecorded(uint256 tokenId, address creator)` | Once, at mint |
| `HistoricalTokenBurned(uint256 tokenId)` | On burn (Layer 3 cleared) |
| `Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)` | Per ERC-721 |
| `Approval(address owner, address approved, uint256 tokenId)` | Per ERC-721 |
| `ApprovalForAll(address owner, address operator, bool approved)` | Per ERC-721 |

## Rationale

### Why Three Layers Instead of One Extended Mapping?

A single `mapping(uint256 => OwnershipRecord)` struct was considered but rejected because:

- **Layer 1 and Layer 2 have different mutability guarantees.** Layer 1 is write-once; Layer 2 is append-only; Layer 3 is freely mutable. Mixing them in one struct obscures these invariants.
- **Separate mappings allow independent optimization.** `hasEverOwned()` uses a dedicated `mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool))` for O(1) lookups without touching the history array.
- **The mental model is clearer.** Developers can reason about "which layer am I modifying?" during code review.

### Why O(1) `hasEverOwned()` Instead of Array Scan?

The most common on-chain query is: *"Has this address ever owned this token?"* — used for governance, airdrops, and access control. A linear scan of the history array would make this O(n) where n is the number of transfers, which becomes unbounded over time. The dedicated `_hasOwnedToken` mapping guarantees constant-time lookups at a cost of one additional `SSTORE` per first-time owner per token.

### Why Preserve History After Burn?

Burning a token destroys its economic value but not its historical significance. A burned Bored Ape still has provenance value — who created it, who held it, when it was destroyed. Legal disputes, insurance claims, and historical research all benefit from preserved Layer 1 and Layer 2 data. The storage cost is already paid; clearing it would refund a small gas amount but destroy irreplaceable data.

### Why an Append-Only History Instead of a Merkle Tree?

Merkle trees compress historical data but require off-chain computation to verify membership. The entire point of this standard is that **other smart contracts** can query history natively. An append-only array is directly readable by any contract via `getOwnershipHistory()` without proof submission.

### Why Deduplicate `_everOwnedTokens`?

Without deduplication, a token bouncing between Alice and Bob (Alice → Bob → Alice → Bob) would add the token ID to each user's list on every transfer, growing unboundedly. The `_hasOwnedToken` mapping prevents this — each address appears in a token's per-address list at most once.

### Why Split Core and Analytics?

The core interface (`IERC721H`) is intentionally minimal: origin tracking, O(1) membership checks, O(log n) historical resolution, and pagination. This covers the fundamental composability gap in ERC-721 — enabling other contracts to query ownership history natively.

Convenience functions like `isEarlyAdopter()`, `getProvenanceReport()`, and per-address token enumeration are useful but domain-specific. Moving them to an optional `IERC721HAnalytics` extension keeps the core interface small, orthogonal, and easier to implement. Contracts signal analytics support via `supportsInterface(type(IERC721HAnalytics).interfaceId)`. Minimal interfaces have a stronger track record of adoption across the ecosystem.

### Gas Trade-offs

Reference implementation measurements (Solidity 0.8.30, optimizer enabled, 200 runs) show the following approximate overhead relative to standard ERC-721:

| Operation | Approximate Overhead | Cause |
|:----------|:--------------------|:------|
| Mint | ~6–7× ERC-721 | 3 layers + Sybil guards + history arrays |
| Transfer | ~3–4× ERC-721 | 2 SSTOREs (history, block) + Sybil guards + dedup check |
| Burn | Comparable or lower | Layer 1 & 2 slots are not cleared; varies with storage warmth |
| Read | Free (view) | All queries are `view` |

Exact costs vary with compiler version, optimizer settings, and storage warmth. This overhead is most practical on Layer 2 rollups where write costs are significantly lower. On Layer 1, the higher cost is the explicit trade-off for permanent, trustless provenance.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is **fully backwards compatible** with [ERC-721](./eip-721.md). Every function defined in ERC-721 behaves identically. Wallets, marketplaces, and tooling that interact with ERC-721 will interact with tokens implementing this standard without modification.

The historical extension is purely additive:

- Existing ERC-721 contracts are **not** affected.
- No changes to ERC-721 semantics are proposed.
- Contracts that implement this standard also implement ERC-721 by definition.
- `supportsInterface()` with the interface ID of `IERC721H` allows runtime detection.

### Migration Path for Existing Collections

Existing ERC-721 collections cannot be retroactively upgraded to comply with this standard (storage layout differs). The recommended migration pattern is:

1. Deploy a new contract implementing this standard.
2. Implement a `wrapAndMint(uint256 originalTokenId)` function that locks the ERC-721 token in the new contract and mints a wrapper token with the caller as `originalCreator`.
3. Historical ownership prior to wrapping is not captured — document this limitation to users.

## Test Cases

The reference test suite (16 contracts, 423 tests) validates the following critical behaviors:

- **Layer 1 invariants**: `originalCreator()` and `mintBlock()` remain immutable across transfers and burns.
- **Layer 2 append-only**: `getOwnershipHistory()` grows on every transfer and never shrinks. `hasEverOwned()` returns `true` for all past holders.
- **Layer 2 deduplication**: `getEverOwnedTokens()` contains each token at most once, even after round-trip transfers (A → B → A).
- **Layer 3 compatibility**: All [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) functions (`ownerOf`, `transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`, `approve`, `setApprovalForAll`) behave identically to standard ERC-721.
- **Burn preservation**: After burn, Layer 1 and Layer 2 remain queryable; Layer 3 (`ownerOf`) reverts.
- **Sybil guard (intra-TX)**: Same token transferred twice in one transaction reverts with `TokenAlreadyTransferredThisTx()`.
- **Sybil guard (inter-TX)**: Same token transferred twice in one block (separate transactions) reverts with `OwnerAlreadyRecordedForBlock()`.
- **Binary search**: `getOwnerAtBlock()` resolves the correct owner at arbitrary historical blocks, including blocks where no transfer occurred.
- **Pagination**: `getHistorySlice()`, `getEverOwnedTokensSlice()`, and `getCreatedTokensSlice()` return correct bounded slices and empty arrays for out-of-range inputs.
- **[ERC-165](./eip-165.md)**: `supportsInterface()` returns `true` for ERC-165, ERC-721, ERC-721 Metadata, and `IERC721H` interface IDs.

Test files are provided in [`../assets/eip-XXXX/test/`](../assets/eip-XXXX/test/).

## Reference Implementation

A complete reference implementation is provided in:

- [ERC-721H.sol](../assets/eip-XXXX/ERC-721H.sol) — Core contract (v2.0.0)
- [IERC721H.sol](../assets/eip-XXXX/IERC721H.sol) — Core interface (10 functions, 3 events) + optional analytics interface (12 functions)
- [ERC721HStorageLib.sol](../assets/eip-XXXX/ERC721HStorageLib.sol) — Low-level storage library
- [ERC721HCoreLib.sol](../assets/eip-XXXX/ERC721HCoreLib.sol) — High-level query library
- [ERC721HFactory.sol](../assets/eip-XXXX/ERC721HFactory.sol) — Production factory + collection wrapper (companion, not required for EIP compliance)

### Key Implementation Details

**Architecture (v2.0.0):**

The reference implementation uses a two-library architecture:

- **`ERC721HStorageLib`** — Low-level: HistoryStorage struct, `recordMint()`, `recordTransfer()`, binary search, Sybil guard, pagination.
- **`ERC721HCoreLib`** — High-level: `buildProvenanceReport()`, `getTransferCount()`, `isEarlyAdopter()`.

All library functions are `internal` — inlined at compile time for zero gas overhead.

A companion `ERC721HFactory.sol` provides:

- **`ERC721HCollection`** — Production wrapper: batch minting, supply cap, public mint with pricing/wallet limits, 5 batch historical query functions, configurable metadata URI.
- **`ERC721HFactory`** — Permissionless CREATE2 deployer with deterministic cross-chain addresses and paginated registry.

**Storage Layout (HistoryStorage struct in ERC721HStorageLib):**

```solidity
struct HistoryStorage {
    // Layer 1: Immutable Origin
    mapping(uint256 => address) originalCreator;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) mintBlock;
    mapping(address => uint256[]) createdTokens;

    // Layer 2: Historical Trail
    mapping(uint256 => address[]) ownershipHistory;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256[]) ownershipTimestamps;
    mapping(uint256 => uint256[]) ownershipBlocks;        // O(log n) binary search support
    mapping(address => uint256[]) everOwnedTokens;
    mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) hasOwnedToken;
}

// Main contract:
using ERC721HStorageLib for ERC721HStorageLib.HistoryStorage;
using ERC721HCoreLib for ERC721HStorageLib.HistoryStorage;
ERC721HStorageLib.HistoryStorage private _history;
```

Note: The `_ownerAtBlock` mapping (used in versions prior to v1.5.0) has been eliminated. The Sybil guard is now derived from `_ownershipBlocks[tokenId]` — the last entry tells whether the current block already has a recorded transfer. The `getOwnerAtBlock()` query uses O(log n) binary search over `_ownershipBlocks` instead of a direct mapping lookup.

**Mint (virtual wrapper + internal primitive):**

```solidity
/// @notice Public mint — virtual so inheritors can add supply caps, allowlists, etc.
function mint(address to) public virtual onlyOwner returns (uint256) {
    return _mint(to);
}

/// @notice Internal mint — initializes all 3 layers. No access control.
/// @dev Callers MUST enforce authorization before calling.
///      Safe for inheriting contracts to build custom mint paths
///      (batch, public, allowlist) on top of this primitive.
function _mint(address to) internal returns (uint256) {
    if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

    uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;

    _beforeTokenTransfer(address(0), to, tokenId);

    // LAYER 1 & 2: Record origin + first history entry (via library)
    _history.recordMint(tokenId, to, block.number, block.timestamp);
    emit OriginalCreatorRecorded(tokenId, to);
    emit OwnershipHistoryRecorded(tokenId, to, block.timestamp);

    // LAYER 3: Set current owner (standard ERC-721)
    _currentOwner[tokenId] = to;
    _balances[to] += 1;
    _activeSupply += 1;

    emit Transfer(address(0), to, tokenId);

    _afterTokenTransfer(address(0), to, tokenId);

    return tokenId;
}
```

**Transfer (updates Layer 2 & 3, preserves Layer 1):**

```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)
    internal nonReentrant oneTransferPerTokenPerTx(tokenId)
{
    if (_currentOwner[tokenId] != from) revert NotAuthorized();
    if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (from == to) revert InvalidRecipient(); // Prevent self-transfer (history pollution)

    _beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId);

    delete _tokenApprovals[tokenId];

    // SYBIL GUARD: One owner per token per block number (inter-TX)
    // Derived from _ownershipBlocks via library — zero additional storage.
    if (_history.isSameBlockTransfer(tokenId, block.number)) {
        revert OwnerAlreadyRecordedForBlock();
    }

    // LAYER 2: APPEND to ownership history (via library — auto-deduplicates)
    _history.recordTransfer(tokenId, to, block.number, block.timestamp);
    emit OwnershipHistoryRecorded(tokenId, to, block.timestamp);

    // LAYER 3: Update current owner (standard ERC-721)
    _currentOwner[tokenId] = to;
    _balances[from] -= 1;
    _balances[to] += 1;

    emit Transfer(from, to, tokenId);

    _afterTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId);
}
```

**Burn (clears Layer 3, preserves Layer 1 & 2):**

```solidity
function burn(uint256 tokenId) public {
    address tokenOwner = ownerOf(tokenId);
    if (msg.sender != tokenOwner && !_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, tokenId)) {
        revert NotApprovedOrOwner();
    }

    // Clear approvals
    delete _tokenApprovals[tokenId];

    // LAYER 1 & 2: PRESERVED (immutable history survives burn)

    // LAYER 3: Remove current owner
    _currentOwner[tokenId] = address(0);
    _balances[tokenOwner] -= 1;
    _activeSupply -= 1;

    emit Transfer(tokenOwner, address(0), tokenId);
    emit HistoricalTokenBurned(tokenId);
}
```

**O(1) History Check:**

```solidity
function hasEverOwned(uint256 tokenId, address account) public view returns (bool) {
    return _hasOwnedToken[tokenId][account];
}
```

**ERC-165 Detection:**

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public pure returns (bool) {

    assembly {
        let flag := tload(tokenId)
        if eq(flag, 1) {
            let ptr := mload(0x40)
            mstore(ptr, shl(224, 0x96817234)) // TokenAlreadyTransferredThisTx()

## Security Considerations

### Unbounded History Growth

The `_ownershipHistory` array grows by one entry per transfer. For heavily traded tokens (e.g., wash trading), this array could become very large. However:

- **Reading** the array via `getOwnershipHistory()` is a `view` call and costs no gas.
- **Writing** (appending) is O(1) and costs a fixed ~20,000 gas per SSTORE regardless of array length.
- **On-chain iteration** over the array (e.g., in `isEarlyAdopter`) should be avoided for tokens with large histories. Implementations MAY add a `maxHistory` cap.

### Reentrancy

The reference implementation uses a `nonReentrant` modifier on `_transfer()` to prevent reentrancy during the multi-step state update (Layer 2 append + Layer 3 update). Implementations MUST ensure that external calls (e.g., `onERC721Received`) occur **after** all state mutations.

### Privacy

All ownership history is permanently public on-chain. Users should be aware that transferring a token implementing this standard creates an **indelible, public record** linking their address to the token. This is by design (provenance requires transparency) but may conflict with privacy expectations. Users who require privacy SHOULD use fresh addresses for each interaction.

### Storage Cost Griefing

An attacker could repeatedly transfer a token to inflate `_ownershipHistory`. Each append costs the **sender** gas (not the contract), so the attacker pays for the attack. The `_everOwnedTokens` deduplication ensures that an address's per-address list grows at most once per unique token, limiting the blast radius.

### Pagination Anti-Griefing

All unbounded arrays (`_ownershipHistory`, `_everOwnedTokens`, `_createdTokens`) expose both full-return and paginated-slice functions. Frontends SHOULD prefer `getHistorySlice()`, `getEverOwnedTokensSlice()`, and `getCreatedTokensSlice()` for tokens or addresses with large histories to avoid RPC response limits or mobile wallet stalls.

### Binary Search Complexity

`getOwnerAtBlock()` uses O(log n) binary search over `_ownershipBlocks`. For a token with 1,000 transfers, this requires at most 10 comparisons — negligible gas for a `view` call. The `_ownershipBlocks` array is append-only and strictly monotonic (enforced by the Sybil guard), which guarantees binary search correctness.

### Burn Does Not Delete

Burning preserves Layer 1 and Layer 2 storage. This means storage slots are **not** refunded on burn, unlike standard ERC-721. This is intentional — the historical data has value — but implementers should document this behavior.
