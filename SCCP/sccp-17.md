## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->
Decrease SNX incentives for sETH/ETH Uniswap pool by half to 16,000 SNX per week

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
32,000 SNX per week from inflation rewards are given to the sETH/ETH pool which incentivises liquidity provision to the sETH/ETH pair.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
To neutralise the debt pool skew exposure to ETH which currently stands at about 50% of outstanding synths. Currently there are incentives for holding iETH and providing liquidity into sUSD Curve pool so we should aim to reduce the overall total of SNX rewards given for various incentives.
