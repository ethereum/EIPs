## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Decrease the target Collateralisation Ratio for SNX stakers to 475%.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Given the state of the peg, this sccp proposes to decrease the target collateralization ratio of SNX stakers to 475% from 500% currently.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The peg seem to be increasingly pressured as can be seen [here](https://www.curve.fi/trade/susdv2/SUSD-USDC/4h). 
This is mostly likely due to an increase in usage of synth liquidity for farming and trading purposes as well as the substantial increase in snx held on [exchange wallets](https://snx.watch/holders).
Although I should mention that lowering the target collateralization ratio does increase the leverage of the system, as well as increases the system-wide solvency risks. However, I believe the 25% cut is minimal for the desired effect of peg stability.
