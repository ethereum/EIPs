## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->
I propose increasing the exchange fee back up to 50 basis points to counter the frontrunning bots. 

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
Exchange fees are charged each time a Synth is converted, and this fee is currently set to 30bps as a two-week trial to increase trading volume. But the trading volume has shot up dramatically due to bots, and their trades are very profitable. Increasing it back up to 50 basis points will reduce their profitability while we work on alternative solutions to counter the bots. 

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
The existing exchange fee of 30 basis points was implemented as a trial to test if the front-running risk from trading bots was sufficiently reduced. The extremely high trading volumes and considerable profitabiliity suggests that the risk is still too high. I propose increasing the fee back up to 50 basis points indefinitely until another solution is implemented.
