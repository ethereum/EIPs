## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->
Increase the target Collateralisation Ratio for SNX stakers to 800%.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
There is currently a surplus of Synths (relative to demand) in the Synthetix ecosystem. Increasing the target Collateralisation Ratio will cause some SNX stakers to purchase Synths off the market to burn before they can claim any more staking rewards. 

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
The Synth pegs (both sETH on Uniswap and sUSD on CEX's) are off-peg. This means demand for Synths is low. There are currently other levers in the works that should contribute to tightening these pegs, but one such lever is the Collateralisation Ratio, which a majority of Discord pollers supported increasing to 800% to contribute to increased demand from SNX stakers looking to burn.
