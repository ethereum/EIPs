## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->
Decrease SNX incentives on the sUSD Curve pool to 24,000 SNX per week

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
32,000 SNX per week from inflation rewards are currently paid to the sUSD pool on curve which incentivizes liquidity provision to the sUSD/ DAI-USDC-USDT pool.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
The recent premium on the sUSD peg on Curve calls for taking action as traders feel a disincentive to pay it to buy synths. 
Despite the recent  price run up of SNX, accompanied usually by an increases in supply of synths, the premium has remained, possibly due to two main contributors: 
1) Farming purposes (CRV, foundation led incentives...)
2) Increase in exchange activity

It should be mentioned that although many have been asking for a c-ratio change to stabilize the peg, the discussion under this [research post](https://research.synthetix.io/t/decreasing-c-ratio-vs-decreasing-snx-rewards/91), outlines the pros and cons of doing this.
The main argument for reducing incentives ahead of any c-ratio cut is to set SNX on a more sustainable long-term footing and decrease the leakage of value from minters, to the minimum required that achieves a stable peg.
