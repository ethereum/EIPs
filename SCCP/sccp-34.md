<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SCCP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SCCPs. Note that an SCCP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SCCP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sccp-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->
This is the template for SCCPs.

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->
SNX stakers take no risk in binary options, while market creators have to provide the initial and unwithdrawable 1000sUSD while also adhering to the skew rules and pay for the gas to create the market.
With this in mind the 0.8% to 0.2% distribution of fees doesn't seem fair.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->
Proposal to split the bid fees equally between the market creator and the SNX stakers.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
