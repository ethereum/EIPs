## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Change the current Spartan Council Epoch length from 1 month to 3 months (quarterly).

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Proposing to change the Spartan Council Epoch length to 3 months. Elections will only occur once every 3 months instead of monthly.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Moving to a quarterly epoch will reduce voter fatigue within the token holders.
