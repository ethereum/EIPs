## Simple Summary
Decrease the target Collateralisation Ratio for SNX stakers to 750%.

## Abstract
There is currently a deficit of Synths (relative to demand) in the Synthetix ecosystem. Decreasing the target Collateralisation Ratio will cause some SNX stakers to increase amount of synths minted

## Motivation
The Synth pegs (both sETH on Uniswap and sUSD on Curve) are off-peg. This means demand for Synths is high. There are currently other levers in the works that should contribute to tightening these pegs, but one such lever is the Collateralisation Ratio
