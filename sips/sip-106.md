<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

After the deployment of Synthetix to L2 an issue was identified in the debt register calculation causing debt to increase as more SNX was staked, this fix addresses the issue in the debt register ensuring the debt balance for each staker is accurate.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

The debt register uses a rolled up calculation of all minting and burning events to enable the debt of each staker to be stored on-chain. During post deployment testing two small mints of ~2 wei sUSD were performed. These mints caused the precision in the debt register to be lost resulting in every incremental mint increasing the debt for all stakers. This fix addresses the loss of precision in the debt register restoring the correct debt values.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Phase 0 of OE was designed to minimise the risk to stakers, so it is critical debt does not fluctuate until exchanges are enabled. This fix addresses an edge case where the debt register does not accurately reflect the minted debt of each staker. This is achieved without the need to make any further changes to the debt calculation logic or requiring all stakers to take any action, reducing the impact to L2 stakers.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

The original multicurrency deployment upgraded the old debt register to the new debt register, it did this by calculating the issued nUSD of all addresses and then migrating them to the new debt register. Given that no exchanges have been made on L2 the pDAO will replicate this migration using sUSD issued on L2 to replay and import the debt register with the correct debt values for each address.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

There is an alternative to this debt register fix, which would require a redeployment of the entire L2 contract suite and then ensuring the fix mint event is sufficiently large as to not trigger this precision issue with the debt register. If this path was taken it would require all SNX stakers to migrate their SNX to L2 again, given the impact to the system and the cost of migration to users, it appears that this would be a much worse alternative.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

No interface changes are required.

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation.

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->

N/A

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

Test cases are included with the implementation in [its pull request](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/pull/811).
