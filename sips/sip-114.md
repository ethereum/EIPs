<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
Migrate the existing L1 and L2 bridges to conform to Optimism's standard deposit/withdrawal interface. This standard defines the the function names and signatures for depositing tokens into L2, as well as for withdrawing them back to L1.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Changes to SynthetixBridgeToOptimism.sol (L1 to L2 bridge):
* functions to be renamed
	* `deposit(uint256 amount)` to replace `initiateDeposit(uint256 amount)`
	* `finalizeWithdrawal(address account, uint256 amount)` to replace `completeWithdrawal(address account, uint256 amount)`
* functions to be added
	* `depositTo(address to, uint256 amount)`
* events to be renamed
	* `DepositInitiated(address indexed from, address to, uint256 amount)` to replace `Deposit(address indexed account, uint256 amount)`
	* `WithdrawalFinalized(address indexed account, uint256 amount)` to replace `WithdrawalCompleted(address indexed account, uint256 amount)`

Changes to SynthetixBridgeToBase.sol (L2 to L1 bridge):
* functions to be renamed
	* `withdraw(uint256 amount)` to replace `initiateWithdrawal(uint256 amount)`
	* `finalizeDeposit(address account, uint256 amount)` to replace `completeDeposit(address account, uint256 amount)`
* functions to be added
	* `withdrawTo(address to, uint amount)`
* events to be renamed
	* `DepositFinalized(address indexed account, uint256 amount)` to replace `MintedSecondary(address indexed account, uint256 amount)`
	* `WithdrawalInitiated(address indexed from, address to, uint256 amount)` to replace `Deposit(address indexed account, uint256 amount)`

These contracts will need to be re-deployed.

SynthetixBridgeToOptimism's SNX balance will need to be migrated to the new SynthetixBridgeToOptimism contract, which will be achieved by calling the following function in the old contract:
`migrateBridge(address newBridge)` (https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/SynthetixBridgeToOptimism.sol#L139). To ensure the safety of this migration, a script will be used, ensuring:
* That the new bridge address is valid
* That the new bridge address is a contract
* That the new bridge owner is the same as the old one
* That the old bridge balance is not zero
* That the new bridge balance is zero

Additionally, the migration will be tested on a fork of mainnet before official execution on mainnet.

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->
As Optimism's L2 gains adoption, more and more tokens will begin to move accross the layers. One example of this is the official WETH token to be used in place of ETH in Optimism's mainnet, which will comply to the deposit/withdrawal interface standard. Unless these changes are applied, Synthetix's bridges will need to be interacted with in a different way to all the other bridges. Another reason to migrate now is that a migration in the future could involve the migration of a much larger SNX value.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
