<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Improve the `AddressResolver` to improve protocol upgrades, reduce gas of deployments and further decentralization.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Reduce the complexity of Synthetix contracts using the AddressResolver in three ways:

1. Have all contracts that use `MixinResolver` to be given the immutable `ReadProxyAddressResolver` and no longer require `Owned` functionality
1. Allow all contracts that use `MixinResolver` to have their caches rebuilt by anyone
1. Add to the `AddressResolver` a function to batch and forward requests to build caches of a collection of `MixinResolver` contracts
1. Emit events on address import and cache rebuilding
1. No longer build the list of required addresses a contract needs at runtime in the constructor but rather at compile time where possible.

## Motivation

<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

There are currently three main issues necessitating this refactor:

First, the protocolDAO upgrades are cumbersome, having a plethora of cache rebuilding transactions to be invoked individually. Better to batch these where possible.

Second, as `ReadProxyAddressResolver` is now available and immutable, contracts can rely on it being set at construction and never changed, and ownership can be remove for contracts that only have it for the `MixinResolver`.

Third, as many contracts also need to work on the OVM, we need to keep contracts down in size. As the OVM transpiler adds extra code around opcodes like `SSTORE`, we want to reduce the use of them in constructors as much as possible.

Finally, more emitted events help determine issues by leaving a paper trail of actions performed to be easily traced back.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview

<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->

- `AddressResolver.importAddresses()` to emit an event `AddressImported` for each address added
- `AddressResolver.rebuildCaches()` is exposed (and non-protected), for ease-of use
- `MixinResolver` no longer requires `Owned` as the `resolver` property is set once only on construction (with the expectation that `ReadProxyAddressResolver` will be used.
- `MixinResolver` has a predicate view `isResolverCached()`
- `MixinResolver` has a `rebuildCache()` function (publicly available) for the contract to rebuild its cache. This function also emits a `CacheUpdated` event for each item added to its private cache
- `MixinResolver.requireAndGetAddress()` uses abi.encodePacked for string concatenation and a simpler API.
- `MixinResolver` no longer performs tasks in the constructor. Contracts using the mixin must implement the abstract `resolverAddressesRequired` function.

### Rationale

<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This approach mimics the same functionality as currently on-chain, and does not add any more gas to Synthetix user transactions.

### Technical Specification

<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

```solidity
contract AddressResolver {

    // restricted function
    function importAddresses(bytes32[] calldata names, address[] calldata destinations) external // ... emits AddressImported

    // public function
    function rebuildCaches(MixinResolver[] calldata destinations) external // ... invokes MixinResolver.rebuildCache()

    // event
    event AddressImported(bytes32 name, address destination);
}
```

```solidity
contract MixinResolver {

    // public function
    function rebuildCache() external // ... emits CacheUpdated

    // abstract view
    function resolverAddressesRequired() public view returns (bytes32[] memory addresses);

    // view
    function isResolverCached() external view returns (bool) // ...

    // event
    event CacheUpdated(bytes32 name, address destination);
}
```

### Test Cases

<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

See [PR#904](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/pull/904)

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
