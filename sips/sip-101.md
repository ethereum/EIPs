title: Add new crypto Synths
status: Approved

## Simple summary

Add new long and inverse Synths for six new cryptocurrencies: 
- AAVE (AAVE)
- Uniswap (UNI)
- Yearn (YFI)
- Polkadot (DOT)
- REN (REN)
- Compound (COMP)

## Motivation

Adding long/inverse exposure to a range of new Synths will allow traders to profit from bullish or bearish bets on the value of some of the best-known assets across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. 

## Specification

These Synths will be implemented in much the same way as the other long/inverse crypto Synths. Each iSynth will have upper and lower thresholds. 

## Rationale

Additional crypto Synths will add further utility to the Synthetix protocol. The included assets were chosen based on feedback in the [Synthetix Discord](https://discord.com/invite/AEdUHzt), and were deemed to have sufficient liquidity in a [new report from Delphi Digital](https://synthetix.io/uploads/delphidigital_cryptoasset_liquidity_report_no3.pdf). 

**Update (Jan 14, 2021)**: Please note that the initial SIP also featured Filecoin (FIL), but there was some objection in the Synthetix community so it has been excluded and will be re-voted on. There was also some objection to Bancor (BNT), which was featured in the same Delphi Digital report, so it is not featured here either. 

## Test Cases

## Implementation

These Synths will be added in the upcoming Bellatrix release.
