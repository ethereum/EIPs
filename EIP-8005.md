### Preamble

**EIP-8005** extends the functionality of EIP-8004 to create a secure permission management framework for decentralized AI agents (such as Clawdbots). This proposal allows users to delegate specific actions to these agents while maintaining control and transparency over their assets and interactions.

### Abstract

This EIP introduces a system allowing Ethereum users to define and manage permissions for AI agents using a framework based on delegated call authorization. By integrating enhanced permission checks, audit trails, and multi-signature requirements, users can engage with AI functionalities across multiple devices without compromising their device's security.

### Motivation

As AI agents become more prevalent, the need for secure delegation of tasks is crucial. EIP-8004 lays the groundwork for delegated calls, but current implementations lack fine-grained controls and oversight that are essential for safely managing AI interactions. 

### Specification

#### Components

1. **Delegated Call Authorization**:
   - Utilize the model proposed in EIP-8004 to allow users to delegate specific function calls to their AI agents.

2. **Permission Management Contract**:
   - Create a smart contract that includes:
     - A list of permitted function calls for each AI agent.
     - Time-limited permissions that users can set for delegation.
     - Access control lists (ACLs) to specify what actions can be taken by each agent.

   Example function signatures:
   ```solidity
   function delegateCallAuthorization(address agent, address targetContract, bytes4 functionSignature, uint256 expiryTime) external;
   function revokeCallAuthorization(address agent) external;
   function isAuthorized(address agent, address targetContract, bytes4 functionSignature) public view returns (bool);

3. **Multi-signature Authentication**:

   -Implement functionalities similar to a multi-signature wallet to enforce multi-party approval for sensitive actions performed by AI agents.



4. **Audit Trail**:

   -Capture and log each action taken via delegated calls in the smart contract.

    Example event signature:
   ```solidity
   event ActionExecuted(address indexed agent, address indexed targetContract, bytes4 functionSignature, address indexed user, uint256 timestamp);
   
5. **User Interface**

Develop a decentralized application (DApp) for users to conveniently manage their AI agents, configure permissions, and review logs of actions executed.

### Workflow

#### User Registration

A user creates a permission management smart contract containing various AI agents and their authorized permissions.

#### Action Execution

When an agent needs to perform an action, it checks the permission management contract for authorization.

#### Audit Logging

Each interaction by an AI agent generates a log entry that is publicly accessible and can be reviewed by the user.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that permissions granted are specific and time-bound to minimize risks.
- Robust verification steps to avoid unauthorized actions by agents.
- Maintain transparency by logging all actions performed under delegated permissions.

### Conclusion

EIP-8005 proposes a structured approach to delegating permissions for AI agents through a secure, auditable, and user-centric framework, building on the foundation laid by EIP-8004. This proposal aims to empower users with the flexibility to utilize AI capabilities while ensuring their assets and data remain secure.
