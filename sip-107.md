<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
Add a new long Synth for Curve.fi 's CRV token.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->
If approved, this SIP will add a new synthetic long token sCRV that tracks the price of the ERC-20 CRV found here 0xd533a949740bb3306d119cc777fa900ba034cd52 .

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->
Adding the CRV token will enable the trading of CRV inside the synthetix ecosystem benefiting traders including dHedge who wish to include this token in their portfolio. It will also enable the creation of a Curve same-price pool of the native CRV token with sCRV. The lead developer of Curve Michwill has stated he has previously has had large buyers express a desire for an on-chain method of acquiring CRV and this would likely drive volume via the Curve x Synthetix to Synthetix as a slippage free trade mechanism. 

Further trading volume is likely to be generated as CRV has liquidity mining for the next 4 years and so there will be a steady flow of people looking to buy or sell large quantities of CRV which can be captured via this token and the mentioned curve pool.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
This Synth will be implemented in much the same way as the other long crypto Synths. I have not recommended an inverse synth yet to reduce possible disagreements as they are currently a source of management headaches reseting price limits.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
Delphi Digital has not done an assessment of CRV's available liquidity however Uniswap has an ETH/CRV pool with total liquidity $5.5million (half is CRV), Sushiswap also has an ETH/CRV pool with total liquidity of $10.9million (half is CRV again)

It is also listed on centralized exchanges Binance, Huobi, OKEx and Kraken. Seeing daily volume of 100, 62, 68, 2.8 mill on each respectively with -2% depth of 466,000 , 243,000, 429,000 and 55,000 and +2% depth of 265,000, 330,000, 356,000 and 158,000 respectively. These limits exceed delphi digitals 2% boundaries by 4x if compared to REN on Binance whilst nearly matching FIL's -2/+2% boundaries. Both REN and FIL were deemed to have strong liquidity and approved for listing on Synthetix by Delphi Digital.

I have added a table of the above data and more in the forum post.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
Chainlink already has a decentralized price feed for CRV that is funded by Aave and Curve, this will reduce implementation/maintenance  costs.

### Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
If approved, these Synths could be added in the upcoming release.
