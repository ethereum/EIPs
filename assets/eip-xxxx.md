## Abstract
This EIP requests a one-time community review to explore deploying a smart contract to recover funds from a wallet lost due to a seed phrase error, backed by overwhelming and verifiable evidence of ownership, within Ethereum’s rules, with no security risks.

## Motivation
- A lost seed error locks funds, yet overwhelming and verifiable evidence of ownership exists (e.g., personal .ETH names, exchange KYC, over 1,000 transactions linking to controlled wallets or KYC’d exchanges, and known protocol addresses).
- Similar cases may lock $500M–$1B in ETH, hindering adoption.
- No process leverages protocol flexibility for such recoveries—why not?

## Specification
- *Action*: Deploy a smart contract to access lost funds, subject to community discussion.
- *Security*: Require staker approval (e.g., 20% stake) and a 1-year lock.
- *Focus*: Discuss recovery feasibility for cases with overwhelming evidence.

## Rationale
- Fits Ethereum’s rules—smart contracts are deployable without forks.
- Addresses a self-sovereignty gap, unlocking potential value.
- Sparks debate on protocol potential.

## Backwards Compatibility
No impact on existing protocol.

## Security Considerations
Staker threshold, lock, and transaction history mitigate risks.
