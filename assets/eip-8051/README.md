# KAT vectors
We provide Known Answer Test vectors corresponding to the NIST submission MLDSA repository, and a variant in the same format for the EVM-friendly scheme.

# Solidity contract
We provide an implementation of the verification for both contracts. Tests are provided for the first KAT vectors, where the public key is formatted in expanded version to be readable by the solidity verification algorithm.
