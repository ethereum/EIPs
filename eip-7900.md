## Abstract

This EIP introduces a new EVM opcode `SDELEGATECALL` (secure delegatecall) that enhances security when executing external contract code. It functions similarly to the existing `DELEGATECALL` opcode but additionally returns the deployer's address of the target contract, allowing the caller to verify the authenticity of the contract being called.

## Motivation

The standard `DELEGATECALL` opcode executes untrusted external code in the context of the calling contract, which has led to numerous security incidents and significant funds loss. For example, the [Bybit hack incident](https://x.com/benbybit/status/1892963530422505586) resulted in approximately $14 billion in lost funds when attackers replaced wallet contract code with backdoored versions.

By providing a way to verify the deployer of the target contract, `SDELEGATECALL` allows developers to implement additional security checks before execution continues, mitigating risks associated with malicious contract replacements or backdoors.

## Specification



A new EVM opcode `SDELEGATECALL` is introduced with the following properties:

1. The opcode takes the same inputs as the existing `DELEGATECALL` opcode:
   - `gas`: Gas to allocate for the call
   - `targetcontract`: Address of the contract to call
   - `argsOffset`, `argsSize`: Memory offset and size for call arguments
   - `retOffset`, `retSize`: Memory offset and size for return data

2. The opcode produces the following outputs:
   - `success`: Boolean indicating if the call was successful (1) or failed (0)
   - `deployer`: Address of the account that deployed the target contract
   - `data`: Return data from the called contract (same as `DELEGATECALL`)

3. The opcode SHALL execute the target contract code with the same context rules as `DELEGATECALL`.

4. The opcode SHALL return the deployer's address as determined by the contract creation transaction

5. When the call completes, the stack items are arranged as follows (from top to bottom):
   - `success` (1 for success, 0 for failure)
   - `deployer` (the address of the `targetcontract` deployer)
   The standard return data is placed in memory at the specified `retOffset`

6. If the contract was created by another contract, the deployer address SHALL be the address of the creating contract, not the transaction sender.


## Rationale

The `SDELEGATECALL` opcode represents a significant security enhancement over `DELEGATECALL` by exposing the deployer's address of the target contract. This design enables smart contracts to implement origin-based trust verification, allowing developers to make security decisions based on the provenance of external code rather than just its current address. With this information, contracts can maintain whitelists of trusted deployers and reject execution from unauthorized sources, effectively preventing many contract replacement attacks.

This security improvement is achieved without sacrificing the core functionality that makes `DELEGATECALL` valuable for proxy patterns and other use cases. The opcode maintains backward compatibility with existing patterns while providing additional security guarantees.

Below is a simple demonstrating the practical application:

```solidity
contract SecureProxy {
   mapping(address => bool) public whiteListed;
   ...
   fallback()external payable  {
   (success,deployer,byte memory data)=sdelegatecall(gas,addr,argsOffset, argsSize,retOffset, retSize);
   if (!whiteListed[deployer]) {
        revert();
    }
   ...
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP introduces a new opcode and does not modify the behavior of existing opcodes, so there are no backward compatibility issues.
If the target smart contract was deployed before the SDELEGATECALL opcode is implemented, it should return ZERO_ADDRESS as the deployer.

## Reference Implementation

TBD

## Security Considerations

While `SDELEGATECALL` provides an additional security layer compared to regular `DELEGATECALL`, several considerations remain:

1. The deployer address alone may not be sufficient to establish trust, as legitimate deployers could also deploy malicious contracts.

2. Contracts using this opcode should implement proper authorization checks on the returned deployer address.

3. In the case of proxy contracts or contract factories, the deployer might be another contract rather than an EOA, requiring more complex verification.

4. This solution doesn't prevent all types of delegatecall attacks, only those involving unauthorized contract replacements.

5. Developers should consider implementing additional security measures such as:
   - Allowlists of trusted deployers
   - Contract signature verification
   - Code hash verification
